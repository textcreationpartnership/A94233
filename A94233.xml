            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:152722:6"/>and return to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Instances of the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which ſome plead to juſtifie a Toleration, it is evident they were tolerated only by the State, (as the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Eutichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp;c.</hi> ſometimes alſo were) to the great grief of all good Chriſtians, and were at the ſame time Condemned for Hereticks and Schiſmaticks by the Church, and all Catholick Councils and Writers; and even by St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that glorious Light of the Latine Church, who does frequently tell the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> their Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick profeſſion of Faith,<note place="margin">Auguſt. Epiſt. 48. &amp; lib. cont. Donatiſtas</note> their true Baptiſm, and valid Ordination, would not avail them to Salvation, till they did renounce their Schiſm, and return to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church. <hi>You are with us in Baptiſm, and in the Creed, and in the other Sacraments of the Lord; but you are not with us in the Spirit of Unity, and Bond of Peace, and in the Catholick Church it ſelf, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe, then what you have, will not be given to you, but will become profitable to your Salvation.</hi> Which he does often tell them, were not at all profitable to them, while they did continue in their Schiſm, and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church. And thus stands the Caſe of the Presbyterians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that keep Conventicles in oppoſition to the Laws of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from her Communion, as it is ſtated by their ablest Patrons.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:152722:6"/>
                  <p>If any afterwards appear to make a better Defence in their behalf, I doubt not but ſome will have time and ability, to ſhew the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Reaſons. For my part I take no delight in Conteſts, and am far from any Rigor or Severity, but I know neither Church nor State can ſubſiſt, if Government be thus deſpiſed, and men not only upon ſuch frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but unreaſonable Pretences, be allowed to foment Schiſms and Seditions. Out of more pity therefore to my Native Countrey, which is like by theſe Diſorders to be involved in Blood and Confuſion again; out of pity, to many poor deluded Souls, who are led blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold into the Paths of Hereſie, Schiſm, and Profaneneſs; and out of care to my own Charge, many of which will not hear any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction that I can give them, I venture to ſend Papers abroad into the World, in hopes they may ſometimes fall into their hands, at leaſt have that good Effect, to prevent others from being ſeduced.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells me, <hi>I ſpeak like one of</hi> Rehoboam<hi>'s puny Counſellors,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apol. p. 196.</note> 
                     <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Experience,</hi> I will tell him my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in a great Pariſh where I am concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after the Biſhop<hi>'s</hi> Preaching and Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing amongſt them ſeveral times, and my weak eadeavours, ſeldom fourſcore came to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip upon the Lord<hi>'s</hi> day, as they ought to do, but upon a little stirring and
<pb facs="tcp:152722:7"/>threatning them, with the Execution of the penal Laws only the <hi>12</hi> penny Act, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, the Church was preſently thronged from one end to the other, and we had eight hundred, or a thouſand People at a time, and we hope by the bleſſing of God, upon the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Word, which is the Administration of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Auguſtin ep. 48. &amp; 50.</note> many will thank us for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, as they did St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the like Caſe, who will tell him more of his Experience alſo in the ſame kind, and I have known the like good ſucceſs in more than one Pariſh, and hope to find it Confirmed more and more by daily experience; and this gives me good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, the ſame moderate Courſe, would in a little time unite us in Peace and Truth throughout the whole Nation, if Conventicles were but taken away, which have been ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to Church and State, and drawn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands to Anabaptiſm, Quakeriſm, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Perdition.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Principles therefore which I inſiſt upon, againſt Papiſts, Independents, Presbyterians, as well as Anabaptiſts, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and Socinians, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as establiſhed by Law, is ſetled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, the Laws of general Councils, and the Tradition of the Catholick Church in all Ages, and is neither guilty of Hereſie nor Schiſm, and that all thoſe are Schiſmaticks, that in <hi>England,</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb facs="tcp:152722:7"/>from her Communion; and this I have aſſerted as heartily as any body, againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists alſo, though not ſo learnedly as others, and ſhall be still ready to maintain it, if they pleaſe to reply to what I have ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> This is another Principle I lay down, which was ever received in the Church, that where there is a true Church, ſetled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the foregoing Rule, there the State ought not to allow any publick Christian Meetings, but ſuch as are approved of by the Biſhops, according to the Laws of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, if they will keep to the Christian Rule.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> That all Perſons that withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either from the ſober Instruction,<note place="margin">See my proofs in my Serious Enquiry and Orig. of Plots.</note> or publick Devotions of ſuch a Church, ought by moderate Penalties, ſuitable to every bodies Conditions, to be compelled to joyn with Her; and if notwithstanding they will ſtill ſeparate themſelves, they are not to be put to death, nor cruelly tormented, or undone, but ſober conference and reaſons ought to be uſed to convince them, and the Penalties still execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to make them hearken and attend to them, which generally Diſſenters and lazy people will not do; and if after all they still ſeparate, they ought patiently to bear their puniſhment, and content themſelves with their private Devotion at home, and leave their Caſe finally to be determined in the general
<pb facs="tcp:152722:8"/>judgment; but no pretence of greater Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or purer Worſhip, can allow them to keep Conventicles, or excuſe their Schiſm in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from ſuch a Church.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Principles which I intend to go by, throughout all my Writings; and if I have not been ſo cautious as to interpoſe theſe terms, always to avoid repetition, I deſire they may be always ſuppoſed and understood. So that if any think fit to reply to what I have ſaid, they must either reſolve to ſet themſelves against the Catholick Church in all Ages, or elſe prove that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has not kept to that Rule which ſhe does profeſs to do, and I think ſhe has, and upon that ſuppoſition have undertaken Her defence, not thinking my ſelf obliged, nor no body elſe, to anſwer for the errour, or hard ſayings of this or that particular Father, or particular Council; but the publick Acts of the Church, and the constant, general, and approved Tradition, wherein as yet I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but truly tending to the Glory of God, and the advancement of Piety; and I believe no body will be ever able to find any thing elſe. I hope therefore the Gallantry of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as it detests all other Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo it will aſſert the ancient Catholick and undoubted order of the Christian Church, now establiſhed amongſt us, not only against the Novelties and Corruptions of the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:152722:8"/>
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> but of all other Diſſenters whatſoever, that our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in true Religion may be as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the World, as ever our Valour has been.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Presbyterians and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, who, I expect will be angry with me, becauſe I tell them the truth, yet if they rightly conſider it, they ought to thank me for the pains I have taken for their Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for 'tis not their Perſons that I write against, but their Errors, which have been ſo fatal to the Peace of the Nation, and do yet endanger our Religion and ſafety; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it their Puniſhment that I deſire, but amendment, and restoring of Holineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to the Church.</p>
                  <p>And the better to induce you to obſerve this peaceable Method, I have endeavoured ſoberly to debate all Matters in Controverſie, and anſwer all Objections againſt Conformity, as well of Clergy as Lay-perſons, and ſet down the Words of <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Bucer</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> concerning our preſent Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, whereby it does appear, that they do perfectly give their Verdict againſt you, if you stand out in your ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>And whereas ſome complain of their hard uſage by the new Impoſitions, they are no other than their own former Diſorders did force the Church upon, to keep her Officers in Peace and Moderation.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:152722:9"/>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1. The Aſſent and Conſent,</hi> is, To hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men from being Hypocrites, and offering up thoſe Prayers to God, which they would Preach against when they had done, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly has been known.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2. The renouncing the Covenant,</hi> is, To prevent men from being tempted to breed Disturbance, and Murder their ſpiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Neighbours, as ſome of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Scotland,</hi> lately did Barbarouſly Murder the Arch-Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and actually appear in Rebellion, to establiſh that wicked Confederacy.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3. The Declarations againſt taking Arms againſt the King,</hi> &amp;c. are but an Expoſition of the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> to provide againſt the equivocating interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Jeſuits and Common-wealths men, who are upon all occaſions stirring up the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Murder and Rebellion, under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of maintaining their Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, neither do they require any more than the Law of Nature, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel does oblige them to.</p>
                  <p>So that if men will ſilence themſelves rather than make theſe Declarations, they muſt not lay the blame upon the Church, but thoſe who taught them ſuch ill Principles, for the Church does not ſilence them, but gives them the like favour with any of her Children, that were faithful to her in the worst of Times.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:152722:9"/>
                  <p>My firſt wiſh and endeavour therefore has been, that you may all Conform and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in your ſeveral ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you are not ſatisfied ſo far as to Conform as Clergymen, yet to perſwade you to leave off your Conventicles, and joyn honeſtly and ſincerely in the publick Worſhip, and live like Chriſtians in Love and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to Convince thoſe that will not Conform at all, that a private Worſhip at home in their own Families, is that which they ought to reſt ſatisfied withal in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, or elſe to repair to ſome other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where they can have a publick Worſhip, according to their Mind. But the Law of Nature and the Goſpel too, forbid them to ſet up Churches against Churches, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the true publick Chriſtian Worſhip, thus orderly ſetled in the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If any will not be perſwaded to any of theſe things, I do utterly diſclaim all ſanguinary Puniſhments, or cruel Torments, purely upon the Account of Religion, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move for moderate Diſcipline, to make them hear and conſider.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Wickedneſs and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you complain of, you cannot but be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, they are in a great meaſure owing to your Diviſions; but yet notwithſtanding, that
<pb facs="tcp:152722:10"/>does not hinder you, from being holy and exemplary in your Lives, and doing your Duty; may you not offer up your Prayers with all purity of heart? your praiſes with all chearfulneſs and joy? and if you will joyn with the Church, there is no Biſhop and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Clergyman, but will heartily concur with you in a Chriſtian way, to reform the Errors and Vices of the Age, as much as can be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally expected; for the true Churchmen deſire and endeavour nothing more, than to promote Piety and Concord in the Nation. But when we have done all we can, there will be irregular and diſorderly Perſons; but the way to reduce them to Obedience, is not by your continuing in your Separation, but by uniting with the Church, and aſſiſting her to uphold Diſcipline and Order.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh therefore your Charity be as great, and Intentions towards us, but as kind as ours are towards you, and your zeal against Popery and Prophaneneſs as hearty and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, as you have ever found ours to be upon all occaſions. And I am ſure you cannot but confeſs, that the pure word of God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preached by the Conformiſts throughout the Nation; the Sacraments duly Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and all Perſons are generally taught, and if they do not wilfully ſhut their eyes, may both know, and do their Duty; and that our Labours, ſometimes have no better effect,
<pb facs="tcp:152722:10"/>is, becauſe you amuſe and diſtract the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by your Oppoſition and Diviſions. For there is not any duty of Religion, that is not taught and practiſed in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and which you may not obſerve in her Communion; but only you will not heartily unite with us, if you cannot perform it your own way, and prostitute the Government and publick Worſhip of the Church, to the private fancies, and arbitrary pleaſure of every ſingle Congregational Paſtor.</p>
                  <p>But if all that I have ſaid,<note place="margin">Defence of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Love. page 88.</note> do not prevail with you to this purpoſe, yet meditate upon theſe words of Mr. <hi>Baxter. The Covenant bindeth us to Reformation, according to God's Word, and the Example of the beſt reformed Churches; but to prefer no publick Worſhip, or a worſe before the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, is Deformation and Prophaneneſs. And it is greater Reformation to prefer the Liturgy before none, than to prefer extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate publick Worſhip before the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. And all Reformed Churches in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, do commonly profeſs to hold Communion with the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Churches in the Liturgy, if they come among us where it is uſed. Therefore it ſeemeth to me to be Perjury and Covenant-breaking, either to prefer no publick Worſhip before the Liturgy,</hi> or to <hi>refuſe occaſional Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Churches that uſe the Liturgy,
<pb facs="tcp:152722:11"/>as meerly upon that account unlawful.</hi> God in his mercy open your hearts to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things, that you may not any longer hinder the ſettlement of Peace and Holineſs in the Nation, and have them repreſented to your Confuſion of Face at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the earnest Prayer of,</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ENgland</hi> for the pleaſantneſs and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of its Soyl, wiſdom and valour of its Inhabitants, excellency of its Church, and juſtneſs of its Government, may truly be called the fortunate Iſland; and were it not for the Diviſions and Factions at home, might be justly accounted the Paradiſe of the World. Amongſt all the Deſigns therefore, to promote the Honour and Wellfare of our Nation, there are none ought to be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully purſued, as thoſe that tend to a cloſure of our Differences, and ſecuring Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the enjoyment of theſe ample Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. For elſe the richer and pleaſanter our Country is, ſo much the more will it be expoſed to Rapine and Diſtraction. I ſhall endeavour therefore, with all brevity, as much as can ſtand with clearing the Matters in Controverſie, to lay down a moderate Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, how to ſettle Peace and Holineſs, and ſo to prevent all Diſturbances in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the time to come. And had I been to write on this ſubject forty years ago, then indeed there could have been ſmall hopes, that
<pb facs="tcp:152722:12"/>what was offered ſhould at all be regarded; men naturally, after long eaſe and quiet, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of their own happineſs, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſee Changes and new things, in hopes of greater ſatisfaction. But now ſince they have ſound the miſchief of that vain Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Wounds in many are still freſh, that they received in the late Confuſions, and there's ſcarce a noble or conſiderable Family in the Kingdom, which has not the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scars of that unhappy Experiment; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks there ſhould not need many Arguments to perſwade our Country-men to return to their former quiet, no more than to induce a weary Traveller to rest himſelf, or a man in great pain to admit of an aſſwageing Plaister.</p>
                  <p>But still I know it will be demanded, What are theſe comfortable Remedies that will bring us to rest and peace; for they are ſo deſirable things, that no ſober man can refuſe them? Now to be able to give a ſatisfactory Anſwer to this Question, it will be neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Controverſies which are alledged as the Grounds of our Diviſions, and thence to proceed to ſeek out the Means which have been uſed in former Times to prevent ſuch Miſchiefs. And that I may ſhorten my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Work, I need not now enter into any debate concerning the Principles of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts and Quakers; for I have formerly proved them to be Hereticks, and condemned for
<pb facs="tcp:152722:12"/>ſuch by the Catholick Church, in the third General Council held at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and by the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, and by all ſetled Churches now extant in the World. Neither is it requiſite I ſhould repeat what I have writ against the Papiſts here in <hi>England,</hi> to prove them guilty of Schiſm, from the Laws of the General Councils, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tradition of the Catholick Church in all Ages, which are Principles they do own, and ought to be concluded by.</p>
                  <p>And by the ſame Authority I did as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prove the Presbyterians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants alſo, that ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and keep Conventicles against her Command, to be guilty of Schiſm. But what has been ſaid against them, being replied upon in a new Method by two learned Advocates, ſomething may very ſeaſonably be added in anſwer to their Pretences; not that the Cauſe it ſelf does stand in need of any farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, having been lately managed with ſo much learning and acuteneſs by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> and another Reverend Author in defence of the Dean, and alſo by my Reverend Brother in his anſwer to the <hi>Melius Inquirendum.</hi> But the ſubſtance of the Matter in Controverſie, may be drawn into a narrower compaſs, and more particularly applyed to the preſent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made againſt our Church, to excuſe
<pb facs="tcp:152722:13"/>the ſeparate Meetings from being Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Beſides many things are here ſpoken, which did fall under their Conſideration, and all more particularly handled to diſpoſe the way to the Churches Peace.</p>

But when I conſider'd that my deſign was ſomewhat larger than onely the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt Diſſenters, and this Book of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, and many others; and the tranſactions in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſince I publiſhed my Book, were carried on by the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Party, juſt according to theſe methods which I had ſhewed to be the original of all our Plots and diſtractions upon the account of Religion, I thought I had a good opportunity offered to illuſtrate my firſt intentions, and to prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſome ſuch courſe as I had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if ever Chriſtians did really endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after peace and ſettlement in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And one thing more does make this defence of my ſelf almoſt neceſſary, to take off that ſlander and publick infamy which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152722:15"/>theſe few lines wherein Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions me, as they are joyned to that part of his diſcourſe which repreſents the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Murder and Cruelty upon the account of Religion, muſt unavoidably leave in the minds of his Party (few whereof perhaps have ever read my Book) as if I had been an Abettor of ſuch bloody Proſecutions, as <hi>Gardiner, Bonner, Calvin, Beza,</hi> and the Murderers of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> when the deſign of my whole Book was againſt it then: And yet his prefixing my name before ſo many worthy men who far exceed me in learning and dignity in the Church, and whoſe Writings were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed long before I ſet Pen to Paper, will make the world apt to think, that this Book was principally intended againſt me, and I am moſt deeply concerned in thoſe bloody and cruel inſinuations. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be fair, and ingenuous, and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that peaceable and Chriſtian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which he doth pretend to, I leave any rational man to judge.</p>

                     <p>MR. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Preface to the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts Plea for Peace tells us, <hi>My honest Friend, whom I. perſwaded from Anabaptistry, Writing against Separation, ſaith, that when he ſaw here a Leg, and there an Arm in the way, it was time for him to stop. But in Church Hiſtory I have had a ſadder ſight, even the Carkaſſes of thouſands, ſtreams of Blood, and Tumults in the Chief Cities and Churches in the World, the Crowns of Emperors and Kings, the loſs of the Eaſtern Empire, the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Papacy, the reproach of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that by Clergy Damnation and Contention, ſtriving who ſhould be greatest, and ſeem wiſeſt.</hi> This I had obſerved long before, and with a great deal of grief and ſadneſs, of heart lamented it in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; and withal had conſidered from what Original theſe evils did ſpring, and what were the likelieſt means to put an end to theſe Butcheries and Confuſions amongſt Chriſtians. But alas! I was not of that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152722:16"/>Eminence and Authority in the World, that what I could propoſe in this nature, ſhould be likely to be regarded, or take much effect towards the healing of theſe Diſtempers, nevertheleſs at the diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, when all the Kingdom were in a great terror and conſternation, and when every body was groaning under theſe ſad Calamities, and deſirous to be freed from theſe Fears and Jealouſies of being burnt in their Beds, or having their Throats cut, and their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren deſtroyed, or made a prey to ſuch mercileſs and bloody Murderers, I thought then a ſerious inquiry into the cauſes and remedies of theſe diſtractions, would make ſome impreſſion upon the minds of men, and be readily embraced by all ſober and well-meaning Chriſtians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I named my Book, <hi>The Original of all Plots in Christendom, together with the danger and remedy of Schiſm.</hi> Which I ſhewed to be the root of thoſe bloody Murders, as well as of Spiritual evils and diſtractions.</p>
                     <p>Now that Schiſm in general was the ground of all theſe calamities, I find all People are readily convinced, but who are the Schiſmaticks ſtill is all the Controverſie. The Papiſts on one hand, who confeſs they have put many men to death upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152722:17"/>the account of Religion, and by cruel torments terrified others from departing from their Communion, brand them firſt with the name of Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, whom they have thus inhumanely Butchered, and ſay it was but execution of Juſtice, and inflicting of ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the hainouſneſs of their crimes did rightly deſerve. On the other hand, thoſe that now call themſelves the Proteſtant Diſſenters, have had their hands imbrued in blood, ſometimes in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and barbarous manner by Tumult and Violence, and other times with a mock pretence of Juſtice, and a Holy Zeal for the Cauſe of God, as is too too evident in the Hiſtories of Modern times, and in the defence that <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> make for it, in the way of a legal Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that matter of fact being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Papiſts and Presbyterians were actually ingaged in blood, ſometimes in a Tumultuous manner, and ſometimes under a colour of Juſtice:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Orig.</hi> of Plots, Chap. 2.</note> I proceeded to examine into the Original of Government, and there ſhewed that all power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Civil Governours was from God, and that all the right of Temporal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion was inveſted in the hands of the Supream Magiſtrates in their reſpective Countries, ſo that neither the Pope <hi>in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152722:17"/>prdine ad Spiritualia,</hi> had any Authority to depoſe Princes, or ſtir up their Subjects to Rebellion againſt them; nor the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or <hi>ordines Regni,</hi> under their right, could by force and violence depoſe a King, or extort the Adminiſtration of Juſtice out of his hands, and conſequently all Wars, and external coertion uſed in a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary way againſt the Magiſtrate, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or againſt his Commiſſion, (except in private aſſaults of Thieves and the like, wherein every man is a commiſſioned Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer for his natural defence) were to be accounted no other than Rebellion, and ſo declared by the ancient Fathers for a thouſand years together, and ever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſince by the greateſt part of the moſt eminent Divines, ſome Papiſts and Presbyterians excepted, and ſuch other diſturbers of the Publick Peace.</p>
                     <p>And having by this means cut off all pretences of Rebellion and Tumult to propagate Religion, if men would hearken to the Churches Doctrine in this point, and prevented Subjects from making any diſturbance, and ſtaining their hands with the blood of their Soveraign, or any of their Fellow Subjects in order to a Reformation in Religion, that I might wholly take off all grounds of future Murders on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> I did farther enquire into the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152722:18"/>thority of Princes in executing capital Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for Hereſie, and other Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical offences, which were held privately, without any Sedition, or violation of the Civil Peace, and did alſo prove that no men ought to be put to death purely upon the ſcore of Religion, if they did not by any attempts or Conſpiracies endanger the Temporal Government, or petulantly Blaſpheme the Divine Majeſty, or his ſacred Religion, and that this alſo was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Chriſtian Church. And that they were only the Schiſmaticks and Diſſenters that did propagate Religion by Murder and Cruelty, but ſuch Practiſes were alwayes condemned by the true Catholicks.</p>
                     <p>And having thus ſhewed that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the Tradition of the Catholick Church were wholly ſtrangers to ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and did teach men love and obedience, upon farther enquiry I found that Papiſts to maintain the unjuſt Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the Pope over the Biſhops and all Chriſtian Churches; and Presbyterians to encourage the People in diſobedience and oppoſition to Epiſcopal Superiority,<note place="margin">Ch. 4. &amp; 5.</note> did ſtir up their Diſciples to Blood and Murder, and ſo filled Chriſtendom with Barbarous Cruelties and Maſſacres, this is notorious on both ſides, and ſeveral of the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland</hi> have dyed lately
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152722:18"/>glorying in this opinion, though condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Traytors for it.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe being thus found out, the next enquiry was after the Remedies of theſe miſchiefs, which were laying aſide all paſſion and prejudice, hearkening to the ſober advice of Learned and impartial men, eſpecially ſubmitting to the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and determination of the Chriſtian Churches,<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> that being the means our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf left to quiet all our Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>if he neglect to hear the Church,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>let him be unto thee as an Heathen man, and a Publican.</hi> And the better to enforce the obſervation of this method, I did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew the reaſonableneſs of it, and that it was the ſame that all Mankind by the light of nature did uſe in moſt other diſputes, and then in my conſiderations to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the uſefulneſs of it, if not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and that, as matters now ſtand, there is no other probable means to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive thoſe People who mean honeſtly on both ſides, and are meerly held in blind obedience to their ſeveral Parties,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to men of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> and ſo carried on with an ignorant zeal, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute all the bloody deſigns their crafty Leaders will put them upon to uphold their Tyranny.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:152722:19"/>
                     <p>But leſt any body ſhould think that I had propoſed ſome new and unheard of method,<note place="margin">Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</note> or a way that was like to involve us in greater difficulties than we were in already, or at leaſt, conſidering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Nation, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, and impoſſible to be obſerved, I did moreover lay down in my Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations to the Papiſts, how far this rule of Unity, and method of ending Controverſies, was aſſented to by the judicious Divines of all Parties, as is to be ſeen Chap. 2. Pag. 188, 189, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein I ſet down the words of the <hi>Greek, Roman, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Confeſſions about it. And when I had ſhewed the agreement in general, I farther added, that the Concord was as manifeſt in all the ſubſtantial and moſt material points of Religion that have been from Age to Age maintained in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and delivered down all along by a clear and uninterrupted Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thence it was very natural to enquire into the grounds of theſe Diſſenſions about which Chriſtendom is now divided, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were in the general ſo fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed. Then as I hinted before, the great quarrel ariſing from the affectation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Dominion and Rule in the Church,<note place="margin">Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations to Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</note> or as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Phraſeth it from <hi>Clergy Domination,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 2, 3.</note> I examined into the Divine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152722:19"/>right of Epiſcopacy, and ſhewed that it was Inſtituted by Chriſt, all along main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ained in the Church, and that for Fifteen hundred year, there was no other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ever known or allowed, nor any Ordination accounted valid, but what was made by a Biſhop. And to remove all poſſible ſcruples, did examine into the other pretences againſt the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> which are uſed by Diſſenters to blind the ignorant from diſcerning their contentions for unjuſt Dominion, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from obedience to their lawful Superiors. And as a farther ſtrengthening of my cauſe, I did make it appear that it was the deſire of the firſt Reformers, that Epiſcopacy might be continued, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of thoſe Churches that now want it, have expreſſed their earneſt deſire to have it reſtored. So that the crime of Schiſm does manifeſtly lye upon thoſe who refuſe obedience to their lawful Biſhops, in all juſt commands, and the guilt of blood will be heavy upon all thoſe that have been engaged to foment Seditions and Murder on this account.</p>
                     <p>Next I proceeded to Conſiderations to thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein I ſhewed that Authority which the Pope challenged over the Biſhops and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, was meerly a Uſurpation contrary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152722:20"/>to the Laws of the general Councils and Tradition of the Church, and contrary to the known profeſſion of the greateſt part of Chriſtendom, which did ever reſiſt and condemn ſuch a groundleſs Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the better to convince the Papiſts of their Schiſm here in <hi>England,</hi> did alſo ſhew that thoſe their points in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie which the Church of <hi>England</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, were not alwayes held in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor had any Foundation in any general Law or Ancient Tradition of the Church, and therefore that they, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their boaſts of Antiquity, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, and adhering to the Catholick Church, did follow a private and novel faction in oppoſition to the known rules of Chriſtianity, which do bind them to live in the Communion of their own Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and yield obedience to all their juſt commands, as thoſe of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> were; and becauſe there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Objections raiſed againſt our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I did briefly anſwer them all, and in the Concluſion make it evident, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> had kept her ſelf within the rule of Catholick Tradition in all her Conſtitutions, and the points in difference, between her and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were meerly introduced for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ends, to uphold the unjuſt Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152722:20"/>of the Pope, and conſequently the schiſm, and all other miſchiefs of Blood and Murder that have been committed in this Quarrel, are chargeable upon the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and her adherents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but cannot any wayes be imputed to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any of her obedient Members and Diſciples, that keep within the bounds of her moderation.</p>
                     <p>After I had advanced thus far, and ſhewn the Univerſal agreement of all ſetled Churches in the World, both in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principle of being guided by the Laws and Tradition of the Catholick Church; and that they did agree in the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial points thus delivered, and that thoſe particular differences upon which they grounded all their contentions, were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinions, brought in for Secular ends, contrary to ancient Doctrine and received Tradition of the Primitive and Catholick Church: I might then with good reaſon in my Conſiderations to Stateſmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> urge the maintaining of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as now Eſtabliſhed, and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Popery and Fanaticiſm, which were both condemned by the Catholick Church, as the moſt neceſſary and rational means to quiet all our Diſſenſions, and the ſafeſt Foundation for them to rely upon for their own Salvation.</p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:152722:21"/>
                     <p>And however they were moved with what I had ſaid, yet I might have hopes that the truly pious and devout Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their conſtant adhering to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and Religious frequenting of her Publick Service with all purity, which they ſaw built upon ſuch a firm Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the conſtant Tradition of the Catholich Church, and that they were ſure to dye in her Faith and Communion, if they did but faithfully obſerve theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Rules and Conſtitutions. And to this duty I did moſt heartily exhort them in my Conſiderations to all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as being the certain and undoubted way to Peace and Comfort in this World, and Salvation in the World to come.</p>
                     <p>And then, laſt of all, when the Church of <hi>England</hi> was thus happily ſetled, and a ſure and laſting method had been laid down to prevent blood and confuſion, the next care ought to be, how to uphold this excellent conſtitution, and to prevent the ſpreading abroad of Sedition and Faction which may poſſeſs the Peoples minds againſt this happy Government, and ſo ſecretly make way to undermine this excellent order which is now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bring us back again into the former miſery and confuſion. Therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152722:21"/>againſt this danger, I did in the end of all joyn a Diſcourſe, ſhewing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs and miſchief of Toleration, which I did prove from Scripture, the conſtant Tradition of the Chriſtian Church, and the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, who called the ſix General Councils, and had their advice in this matter, and laſtly from the conſtitutions of moſt Religious States and Societies in all Ages.</p>
                     <p>Now if I have clearly made out theſe points, what more ſatisfactory work or pleaſing proſpect could I offer to any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and peaceable mind amidſt all theſe miſeries and diſtractions, when he could ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a quiet Habitation, the Church of God built upon a Rock, and ſtand unſhaken amongſt all the boiſterous ſtorms and raging waves of Schiſms and Hereſies that threaten her overthrow, and all theſe ſecure of their fafety, that keep within her Obedience and Communion, and thoſe only in danger, and deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Faction, Sedition and Blood-ſhed, that ſtraggle out of her Paths and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>And as this bleſſed Contemplation muſt be pleaſant to all true Catholicks, ſo the Motives of it cannot but be the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means to undeceive all well-diſpoſed Chriſtians, that are engaged in the Society
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152722:22"/>of theſe novel Factions, that have upheld their unjuſt affectation of Dominion, by ſuch bloody and Schiſmatical courſes. For if the Church of <hi>England</hi> be founded upon that ſenſe of Scripture, which has been received down all along by Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ratified by the Laws of the whole Church, and Decrees of general Councils; and thoſe private opinions, which Papiſts and other Diſſenters alledge as grounds of their Separation, be novel inventions, either wholly beſides, or contrary to the Churches publick Conſtitutions, certainly all rational and peaceable minded men muſt think it ſafer to live in obedience to their own Governors, which the Law of nature does firſt of all direct, when they ſhall have the Authority of the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Martyrs, and the conſent of the Catholick Church on their ſide; and let but Papiſts and other Diſſenters heartily ſubmit to thoſe Rules, and all our Schiſms and Plots will be at an end.</p>
                     <p>Againſt this the Papiſts have made no reply, nor the Anabaptiſts nor Quakers, only Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is pleaſed to make me feel the ſtroak of his Pen, and joyn me with <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi> and <hi>Bonner,</hi> and ſuch bloody Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, though he knows the main deſign of my writing was to prevent ſuch inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Butcheries. And being thus driven
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152722:22"/>by him to defend my ſelf, my cauſe is ſo interwoven with that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that I am forced to joyn both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame Apology.</p>

                     <p>But the Doctor there goes on to deſcribe things more particularly, the end of it [the Church] is, 1. <hi>Preaching the word, unto the Edification of the Church it ſelf, and the Converſion of others.</hi> 2. <hi>The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacraments, or all the Mystical appointments of Christ in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.</hi> 3. <hi>The Preſervation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Evangelical Diſcipline.</hi> 4. <hi>Viſibly to profeſs their ſubjection unto Christ in the World, by the obſervation of his Commands.</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:152722:25"/>5. <hi>The bounds and limits of this Church, are taken from the number of the Members, which ought not to be ſo ſmall, as that they cannot obſerve and do all that Christ hath commanded in due order; nor yet ſo great, as not to meet together to anſwer the end of the Inſtitution of Christ before mentioned.</hi> Therefore if Pariſhes be ſo great, as that the Inhabitants have not convenient room to hear God's Word and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, they ought to be divided, and ſome other place be allotted, where they may enjoy all God's Publick Ordinances. 6. <hi>This Church in its compleat nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a Pastor, or a Pastor and Elders, who are its Guides and Rulers, and the Community of the faithful under their Rule.</hi> 7. <hi>That unto ſuch a Church belongs of Right all the Priviledges, Promiſes and Power, that Chriſt doth give and grant unto the Church in this World:</hi> That is, to any particular Church, elſe there are greater Priviledges of indefectibility granted to the Catholick Church. Now what is there here in all this Deſcription, but may be duely obſerved in a Dioceſan Church? For to every Member of the ſame the Word may be Preached in their reſpective Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, the Sacraments Adminiſtred, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline exerciſed, and viſible profeſſion of ſubjection to Chriſt made, and limited
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152722:25"/>within ſuch bounds as theſe Inſtitutions of Chriſt may be orderly obſerved. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, the Paſtor to overſee and govern all, and the ſeveral Pariſh-Miniſters as El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, under him actually to Adminiſter all Offices belonging to Perſonal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet with reſpect ſtill to the Biſhops Government and Advice. And laſtly to a Church thus conſtituted, and every one of them, belongs of Right all the Priviledges, Promiſes and Power that Chriſt doth give and grant unto the Church in this World. Namely Regeneration, and Sanctification, the gifts and graces of God's Spirit to conduct it here, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification in the World to come.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>O.</hi> would indeed ſeem to inſinuate that all theſe things can never be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except in one individual Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the nature of the things do not at all require that, and therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any means infer ſuch a conſequence; all that will follow, is, that every Church-Member ought to have a place to reſort to, where there is a Perſon duely qualified to Adminiſter the Word and Sacraments in due order, and for a time till farther Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, to debar all ignorant and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons from the Communion, and this every Pariſh-Miniſter can do without his Biſhop. But what hinderance is it to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152722:26"/>all theſe ends, for a man to have a Biſhop beſides to go to, if need be, to give him farther advice, and to help and direct the Miniſter in promoting Piety and good order in his Pariſh, by the greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and influence he has over them? To ſay that there are many defects in the management of affairs in this order, and theſe ends are not alwayes attained, will be no objection, for the Congregational way is lyable to male-Adminiſtration, as well as this, and expoſed to a great many more miſcarriages and inconveniencies, and ſuppoſing men of equal care and Piety, the Dioceſan is much more advantageous than the other. But the abuſe or neglect of ill men ought not to be objected againſt the order it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>So that the Controverſie is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ought to be Governors appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt to Adminiſter the Word and Sacraments, and to keep up a viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Order and Holineſs in the World; that is confeſſed on all hands: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt has appointed fulneſs of all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant</hi> Power to each Congregation in order thereunto. That a Biſhop ſometimes in the firſt planting of the Goſpel, might have no more under his charge, than he could perſonally Adminiſter all Offices to, no body does deny; but that Chriſt has
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152722:26"/>by any Law or Inſtitution of his, confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Church-State to one individual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, it does not any way appear. Neither can that Negative poſſibly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that a Biſhop muſt have no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his charge, than can ordinarily meet together in one place at one time, and this the Doctor is very ſenſible he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove from any Text of Scripture, but would infer it from the nature of the thing. Therefore to prevent his Adverſary from deſiring any ſuch direct Proof, he ſayes, <hi>There are in Scripture general Rules, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting us in the Application of natural light, unto ſuch a determination of all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Acts of Worſhip, as are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for their performance decently and in order. Wherefore as was ſaid before, it is utterly in vain and uſeleſs, to demand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Institution of all the circumſtances belonging unto the Government; Order, Rule and Worſhip of the Church. Or for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of things of themſelves indifferent, unto its Edification, as occaſion ſhall require. Nor are they capable to be otherwiſe stated, but as they lye in the light of nature, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual prudence directed by general Rules in Scripture.</hi> Now all theſe general Rules in Scripture we do moſt heartily ſubmit to, and all particular Rules alſo, and yet we find no obligation in them, nor from any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152722:27"/>Law of nature, to confine all Church-ſtate to the Congregational mode, nor exclude a Dioceſan Church, nor yet Provincial and National, neither can the Doctor name any one Priviledge or Spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, belonging to a private Chriſtian which cannot be obtained in this way, not any duty which may not be obſerved. Nay 'tis evident to experience and common ſenſe, that it is ſo, as I have ſhewed in the Conſideration of his deſcription of the Church-ſtate, and the duties that are to be obſerved in it. And I find it in my own Pariſh, and have heard Miniſters that did formerly practiſe the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way ſay, the preſent Dioceſan Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is more for the good order of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Come we now to conſider what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes about Church-Government. And in his Non-conformiſts Plea,<note place="margin">Pag. 24. n. 17.</note> he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt hath inſtituted a Ministry to be for ever eſtabliſhed in the World, to Preach the Goſpel, to Convert Volunteers unto Faith and Holineſs, and to gather by Baptiſm all Conſenters into his Covenant and Church, and to teach them all that he hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. And this none have power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. He hath ſtated on the Paſtors of ſuch Churches, the power afore deſcribed, of teaching Aſſemblies and particular perſons,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152722:27"/>of leading them in publick Worſhip and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and of judging by the power of the Keyes, whom to receive into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by Baptiſm, and profeſſion of Faith, and whom to admoniſh, and for obstinate Impenitence to reject, and this Institution none may alter.</hi>

For the Paſtors of our Church by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the Magiſtrates likewiſe by their Authority have confirmed ſuch aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Parochial and Dioceſan Churches, and in their Synods made Canons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the obſervation of theſe orders, and that none ſhould Preach but ſuch as are licenſed by publick Authority, and all this is <hi>Concordiae gratia,</hi> and therefore to uſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own words, <hi>If abſent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Biſhops may</hi> Concordiae gratia <hi>be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by God's Law, to keep ſuch Canons as are made for Concord, and ſo they may be the matter of Duty;</hi> ſurely by the ſame reaſon they ought to bind him, and thoſe of his perſwaſion. And what does the Church of <hi>England</hi> require more, but the obſervation of ſuch Canons and Orders, as are made <hi>Concordiae gratia,</hi> by mutual conſent of Paſtors and civil Governours alſo? And why then has Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> any contention about the Government of the

                        <p>Another great Objection with which Dr. <hi>O,</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> fill their Books, is, the want of Diſcipline, and impoſſibility of keeping up order and Holineſs in the Church. And Dr. <hi>O.</hi> ſpeaking of corrupt manners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">En. Ch. p. 209.</note> 
                           <hi>In this State the Church of</hi> England <hi>doth not, and it is to be feared, will not, nor can reform her ſelf.</hi> And Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Abrid. of Councels, p. 13.</note> 
                           <hi>By this means true Diſcipline is become impoſſible and unpracticable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That I may anſwer their Objections to this point of the want of Diſcipline, they muſt ſay it is either for want of power, or for want of exerciſe. And firſt there can be no pretence to ſay, this is for want of Power, for the Biſhops in their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, are both by the Laws of God, and by the Laws of the Church univerſal and particular, ſufficiently Authorized to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate all erroneous and vicious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152722:31"/>perſons, and do conſtantly hold their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations and Courts, to enquire and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe that give offence, and pollute the Holineſs of their profeſſion by their diſorderly lives, and do actually exhort, reprove, excommunicate any that do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately perſiſt in open and ſcandalous ſins, till they publickly profeſs their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reformation of life. If they do Hypocritically diſſemble in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and oath of obeying the Church; who can help that?<note place="margin">En. Ch. p. 208.</note> Dr. <hi>O.</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>We own that wicked Hypocrites may be joyned in true Churches, and be made partakers of all the priviledges of them. Neither is this a cauſe of withdrawing Communion from any Church, much leſs of condemning it as no true Church of Christ.</hi> So that in this Dioceſan aſſociation, it is acknowledged, Diſcipline ought to be exerciſed upon open and ſcandalous offenders, the Biſhops have Authority from the Law of God, and of the Church, to put it in execution, and to hold their Viſitations and Courts, to enquire and exerciſe it, where then is the ground of complaint? or what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is there on this account, for Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? ſo that they muſt ſay this is not done, and 'tis plain, Diſcipline is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed. Whoſe fault is that? ſince the Law is clear, and the Biſhops keep their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152722:31"/>Viſitations and Courts to that end, the blame at laſt muſt lye for want of legal complaints and juſt proof, and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but by the Oath of Witneſſes that know that Perſons are guilty of ſuch open and ſcandalous offences, ſo that this defect of Diſcipline is not to be imputed to the Government, but to the want of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and conſequently the guilt is moſt in theſe that make the complaint, and not in the Biſhops or Conſtitution of the Church. For if they, inſtead of murmuring and complaining amongſt the People, would complain to the Biſhop, or ſtir up the Church-wardens, and other private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to give in legal Information, all this pretence would be wholly taken away, and as matters now ſtand, I do not ſee but Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> are guilty of the neglect of Diſcipline, for they know theſe offences, or elſe why do they uſe them as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and do nothing effectually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them? but the Biſhops do call upon the Church-wardens, and exhort all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to detect publick Offenders, and therefore do what in them lyes to keep up good order in Religious Aſſemblies, and ſo may in all equitable conſtruction be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to admit no wicked men, but ſecret Hypocrites into their Communion, or at leaſt, ſuch as muſt be eſteemed ſo in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152722:32"/>eye of the World, till witneſſes be brought off their open tranſgreſſions, 1 Tim. 5.19. <hi>Againſt an Elder receive not an accuſation, but under two or three witneſſes.</hi> And then what means this hideous exclamation againſt the Biſhops and the Government? And why muſt all the Load lye upon the Church, who does all that ſhe can to keep up Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Holineſs in all her Members, and therefore herein give no cauſe of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from her Communion, if that were enough; But it will be ſaid, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Biſhop has not the knowledge of publick crimes, is, becauſe he lives at ſuch a diſtance, but if the full Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority were allowed to the Paſtor of each particular Congregation, as we think it was anciently, and now ought to be, then he might be able to find out, and reform all publick offenders.</p>
                        <p>This is the pleaſing Dream with which Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> do fill their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and it is but little more than a Dream when rightly lookt into. I confeſs the leſſer the number is, the Biſhop has to look after, the leſs care and trouble it will be to manage his Charge, but 'tis not poſſible without Information and witneſſes, to counſel and puniſh very open and ſcandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offenders, if all muſt depend upon his perſonal knowledge, for how often may
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152722:32"/>a man have very wicked Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in his own Family, and yet for want of Information not know it, or ſo know it, as be able to convince them of their ill behaviour? much more then in a great Pariſh, or a great City, ſuch as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was the Church St. <hi>James</hi> had the charge of, or <hi>Rome</hi> whereof St. <hi>Peter;</hi> or <hi>Alexandria</hi> where St. <hi>Mark</hi> was Biſhop. Was it poſſible for St. <hi>James, &amp;c.</hi> who had 5000 men, and God knows how many more under his care, ſcattered up and down in ſuch a vaſt City, to know publick Offenders without Information and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? Common ſenſe does tell every man he could not. And if there be Witneſſes that can and will Inform the Pariſh-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Preſident of our Congregation, they can as well inform the Dioceſan Biſhop, and then upon proof made, he can as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually exerciſe Diſcipline as the Pariſh-Miniſter himſelf, and with greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Terror to the Offender, and ſo is more likely to bring him to Repentance. To wave many inconveniencies that would follow, if every Pariſh-Miniſter had full and independent Juriſdiction as theſe men contend for, and ſo the great outcry they make, when throughly ſearched into, comes to nothing, and the inconveniencies they urge againſt a Dioceſan Church, are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152722:33"/>no more than are unavoidable if the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be negligent, and careleſs in their Congregational way.</p>
                        <p>Neither do they rightly repreſent the power which God and the Church have given every Pariſh-Miniſter, which they do much vilifie and deprive of his due power in ſtating the caſe. For he can exhort, rebuke and ſuſpend from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for a time,<note place="margin">Rub. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Communi. can. 26.27.</note> and bind <hi>In foro Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiae,</hi> till upon ſubmiſſion or farther examination, the Perſon be looſed by a Superior Authority. And this is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible part of Diſcipline, and enough to keep up a viſible profeſſion of Holineſs in all perſons that he admits to the Holy Communion, but the light of nature does allow of appeals, neither did ever any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment make every ſingle Officer abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and endue him with the higheſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in every kind.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, if Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would a little lay aſide their enmity to the Biſhops, and calmly conſider the caſe, they would find moſt of theſe open and ſcandalous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders do Excommunicate themſelves, and prevent the Churches Diſcipline, and they cannot but know in a divided Church, as they have made ours, and where many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily Excommunicate themſelves, 'tis not by St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152722:33"/>thought adviſeable to purſue them with the Churches cenſures. And as for theſe that do generally approach to the Lord's Supper amongſt us, they do ſhew as viſible a complyance unto the Rule of Chriſt, as even in thoſe duties which they think they neglect, as any of their ſelect Diſciples; but God help us, there is too great contempt of Chriſt's commands in the Nation, and they had more need to joyn all their Forces to uphold the Biſhops Authority to further a Reformation, than by ſuch frivolous pretences to alienate mens minds from all Reverence and attention to their Pious admonitions.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Dioceſan and Provincial Churches, and the Peoples Power in chooſing their Miniſters.</head>
                     <p>THere is agreat deal of ſtir made about the Peoples power in chooſing their Miniſters, and Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Parochial Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s. Congregational Church, is chiefly founded upon a ſuppoſition
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152722:34"/>of the Peoples right herein, but how they can prove it I do not ſee. The Scripture does not give them any ſuch Power as I can find, neither do I find Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> urge any Text for it, neither do our Saviour or his Apoſtles by their example give any ground for ſuch an Authority. 'Tis true, when the People were jealous that their Money was miſapplyed, the Apoſtles in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. did bid them chooſe out men that they had a good opinion of for their Faithfulneſs, but ſtill it was <hi>whom we may appoint over this matter,</hi> and accordingly the Apoſtles only did give them Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and theſe were only Deacons to look after their Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if the Apoſtles did find them fit for higher Offices, that ſtill was in their own choice how far to confer any other Dignity, but it does not appear that the People had any thing to do in it, nor was this left as a rule, but only a preſent expedient to ſatisfie them that their Money was honeſtly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtributed in ſuch a time, when they had not leiſure to examine into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, nor other ſetled maintenance to depend upon. When our Saviour choſe his Apoſtles, and ſent them abroad, and ſubjected all the World to them, he did not ask any bodies leave, but they were bound under Peril of Damnation to obey
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152722:34"/>them, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned;</hi> when the Apoſtles did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Elders in every City, they did not ask the Peoples conſent before-hand, but appointed them their charges, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all People, <hi>To obey them that have the Rule over them, Heb.</hi> 13.17. The like Commiſſion the Apoſtles gave to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and all other Biſhops, and ſet down the conditions they were to obſerve in chooſing others; but asking the Peoples conſent, or taking ſuch as they ſhould chooſe, is none of them. Nay, <hi>Titus</hi> has full power himſelf, to <hi>ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City,</hi> Tit. 1.5.</p>
                     <p>Now the Paſtoral Office being to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end of the World, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's preſence being promiſed to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and thoſe Biſhops were dead which they appointed, there muſt be ſome order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of continuing a Succeſſion of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Paſtors, for <hi>all things are to be done decently and in order.</hi> Therefore as <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had Authority to ordain Elders, ſo other Biſhops muſt have the like Power committed to them, now all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops being equal in order, and having fullneſs of all power, when any Biſhop did dye, who ſhould chooſe and ordain a new
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152722:35"/>Eiſhop in to the vacant place, if every neighbouring Biſhop ſhould ordain or ſend one, that would breed confuſion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no other way thought of to prevent diſorder, but for the Biſhops to agree together whom to ordain and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the vacant place. But 'tis not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that all the Biſhops in the World ſhould meet, or come to be conſulted upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordination, therefore ſome neighbor-Biſhops muſt have Authority herein, but ſtill it will be a queſtion who they ſhall be, and how many ſhall be concerned, therefore as the Law of decency and order does require the Biſhops ſhould come to agreement among themſelves; ſo in all probability the Apoſtles did give direction for the Erecting of Provincial and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Churches, that if a Biſhop at any time did dye, the reſt of the Biſhops in ſuch a Diſtrict ſhould ſome way or other, either by Aſſembling together, or ſending their conſent, ordain and appoint another in his ſtead. And every Biſhop within his Charge, might chooſe and ordain ſuch Presbyters and Deacons as he thought ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and neceſſary for his aſſiſtance, the fewer Congregations he had to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the fewer Prieſts and Deacons were neceſſary, and as his charge did encreaſe, he had power to ordain more Prieſts for his better ſupply.</p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:152722:35"/>
                     <p>And as in caſe of Death, ſo in caſe of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, Schiſm, or any other hainous crime, 'tis fit a Biſhop ſhould be depoſed, and another ordained in his room, ſo that upon this account alſo, they muſt meet together to hear the cauſe, and examine Witneſſes, <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. and in like manner if he does wrongfully Excommunicate his Prieſts or Deacons, or any other of his Flock; and then in all Aſſemblies there muſt be a Speaker or a Preſident, to propoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to moderate all debates, and to keep good order; and hence was derived the Authority of a Metropolitan, ſo that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans and Provincial Churches, ſeem to be neceſſary according to the Dictates of the Law of nature, and likewiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Apoſtolical Inſtitution. But as for Primates or Patriarchs, or a Pope, they are neither Divine, Apoſtolical, or Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions; but brought in by Princes, and founded upon no Law of the Catholick Church, but their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is wholly excluded, though a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in ſome perſonal Quarrels, with a Metropolitan, is allowed by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to a Primate, or the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and all other matters are finally to be determined by each Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Church, except in caſe of a flagrant Schiſm or Hereſie, wherein the Provincial
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152722:36"/>Church is deſpiſed, and then there is no Authority upon earth, but a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to decide the difference, unleſs it can be made up by an amicable agreement and reference to neighbor-Churches. Now that this was alwayes the conſtitution of the Church, is evident from all ancient Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For Dioceſan Churches, (Antiquity tells us, that St. <hi>James</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>) St. <hi>Peter</hi> firſt at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and then at <hi>Rome,</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> at <hi>Byzantium</hi> now <hi>Constantinople, Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete, &amp;c.</hi> And it does tell us alſo, the Names of the ſingle perſons that were Biſhops after them by Succeſſion, and now in theſe Great and Populous Cities wherein there was a mighty increaſe of Believers, it was not poſſible that one Biſhop could do all by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal labour only, or one Congregation could be ſufficient to hold all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and afford them convenience to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all Ordinances, but that there muſt be ſeveral Aſſemblies, for Preaching, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Sacraments; and ſeveral Prieſts to Miniſter in them; but yet <hi>Ignatius</hi> tells us, <gap reason="foreign">

But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to a little Tractate of <hi>Blundel's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure plebis, &amp;c.</hi> concerning this matter where are ſeveral Teſtimonies to prove that the People did nominate and chooſe their Paſtors in the Primitive times, 'tis too long to examine the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, but if ſuch a thing was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that does not at all prove that they had any right, or their conſent was neceſſary, all that can be gathered from it, is that the Biſhops in thoſe difficult times, the better to induce People to continueſted faſt in the Faith, and contribute to the neceſſities of the Church, did much attend to the Nomination and earneſt Petition of the People, when they did deſire men well qualified for their learning and ſober Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation for ſuch a charge, and this may be very well done without parting with their own right, or acknowledging any power in the People to chooſe their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152722:38"/>any farther, than to give Teſtimony of their Pious lives, and unblemiſht Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and that was all the right indeed, the people ever had in this matter, though much may be yielded to their deſire, and earneſt recommendation in thoſe early dayes, and is ſtill upon all occaſions, but even then they found ſuch Tumults and Diſorders, oftentimes Bloodſhed and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in but allowing popular Nominations, that the Church Univerſal was forced to make a Law to prohibit them wholly, <hi>Con.

                     <p>Neither if ſuch a Nomination were now permitted, would it avail Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> at all, for ſtill the Biſhops were to ordain them, and to judge of their fitneſs alſo, and to depoſe them again in caſe of any unfitneſs, ſo that if the People ſhould chooſe Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, or any other, if the Biſhops did not Approve them, or if they did not obſerve the Canons of the Church, the Peoples choice could not make them their Paſtors, and this judgment of the Paſtors, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does in many places allow.</p>

                     <p>'Tis true, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will ſay, if they find Him unmeet, but if the Perſons choſen by the People, be every way duely capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, then they are bound to admit them; How far the Biſhops may ſometimes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a People, if the Perſon be every way meet and capable is not the queſtion but our Lord foreſaw ſo many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies in this method, that he gave the People no ſuch power, and when the Church ſometime did condeſcend to their importunity, they found ſuch intolerable evils by it, that they were neceſſitated to forbid it.</p>
                     <p>But Perſons chooſe their Husbands and Wives, Phyſitians and Servants, and why may they not chooſe their Biſhops and Miniſters alſo? There is not the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for theſe are private matters only which concern their own perſons and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe, but the publick is concerned in the choice of Miniſters, and therefore thoſe methods muſt be obſerved which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours ſhall appoint in this matter, and which long experience has found to be the beſt to prevent diſorders, and then indeed every man has his liberty to chooſe his own Miniſter and Confeſſor to adviſe him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>private.

                        <hi>doth not leſs relate unto, and receive force from the light of nature, than any other state of the Church whatever. Herein as unto its general nature its Foundation is laid. What that directs unto, may receive new enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by Revelation, but changed, altered, or aboliſhed, it cannot be. Wherefore there is no need of any new expreſs Inſtitution of what is required, by that light and law in all Churches and Societies, for the Worſhip
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152722:43"/>of God, but only an Application of it unto the preſent occaſions, and the preſent ſtate of the Church, which hath been various. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The pretence I confeſs is vain, and therefore let us hear of it no more. Yet we find the Doctor afterward girding at unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and uninſtituted Rites. But the Doctor adds likewiſe, that, <hi>It proceeds from a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Contention—On a ſuppoſed failure herein</hi> [of an expreſs Teſtimony or Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution] <hi>to conclude, that they have power themſelves to inſtitute and ordain ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as they think meet, under a pretence of being circumstances of Worſhip.</hi> But
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152722:43"/>why ſo? May not Governours have a right to make Application of the Law of nature, to determine theſe circumſtances as well as private men, and therefore without a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of contention, we may conclude they have a power to inſtitute and ordain ſuch Ceremonies as they ſhall ſee meet. But this will be more proper under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Head. Let us then hear the Doctor's reaſon, <hi>For as the Directive light of nature is ſufficient to guide us in theſe things, ſo the obligation of the Church unto it, makes all stated additions uſeleſs, as on other accounts they are noxious.</hi> But though the light of nature be ſufficient to guide us in theſe things, may not men indulge their own fancies, and not follow their guide? And then the obligation of the Church will not be uſeleſs, much leſs noxious, when ſhe does tye them to decent circumſtances. But the Doctor goes on, <hi>Such things as theſe are times and ſeaſons of Church-Aſſemblies, the order and decency wherein all things are to be tranſacted in them, the bounding of them, as unto the number of their Members and places of habitation; ſo as to anſwer the ends of their Institution; the multiplication of Churches, when the number of Believers exceeds the proportion capable of Edification in ſuch Societies; what eſpecial advantages are to be made uſe of in the order of Worſhip
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152722:44"/>of the Church; ſuch as are methods in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> [and praying the Doctor ſhould have added alſo.] <hi>Tranſlations and Tunes of Pſalms in ſinging, continuance in publick duties and the like, the things themſelves being divinely instituted, are capable of ſuch general directions, in, and by the light of nature, as may with ordinary Christian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, be on all occaſions applied unto the uſe and practice of the Church.</hi> But have all the like prudence to apply them, or may they not be often miſapplyed? And are not the generality of men careleſs and negligent? And therefore may not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venours provide againſt ſuch defects and indecencies? Scripture has not determined the circumſtances of theſe duties, he ſayes, the light of nature has not determined them, but the Scripture does require they ſhould be done, and the light of nature alſo does direct they ought to be prudently done, but who is this prudent man that muſt determine them? He anſwers, <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Chriſtian prudence may apply them.</hi> And why may not the Governours then apply them? Have they not ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prudence? So that to ſpeak to the preſent matter we are upon, we are to Pray to God, and Praiſe him publickly in the Congregation; The words, the method and the length of the Prayer we are to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152722:44"/>uſe, are not determined in Scripture, nor nature, here Chriſtian prudence muſt come in to order all theſe. And why may not the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> direct the words as well as Dr. <hi>O?</hi> Is it not more reaſonable and fit the Graveſt and Wiſeſt men of the Nation ſhould direct in this matter, than ever young raw Divine be left to his Arbitrary pleaſure? This I leave to any rational unprejudiced man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, and I need ſay no more on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> can and will, in all humane preſumption, make better proviſion for the publick Service, than every particular Miniſter left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, will or ought to be ſuppoſed to do. Beſides, it is the expreſs command of God's Word given to one man, but concerning all, to <hi>Timothy</hi> the Biſhop to ſee it done,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1.</note> that Prayers and Supplications ſhould be made for all men, for Kings and all in Authority, and for all other neceſſities of the Church, and that theſe things ſhould be done decently and in order, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Governours ought not to leave theſe to every bodies pleaſure, to do or not to do them, to perform them decently or undecently, as the humour takes them, but in reaſon ought to preſcribe ſuch Prayers and orders which they know to be full, pious, and comprehenſive, or elſe how do

And if our Liturgy, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, be incomparably better than any of the Forreign or Ancient Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies that he has ſeen, ſurely it is a much better Service than we were likely to have, if it were wholly left to every Miniſter's private conceptions. So that the whole Controverſie, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has ſtated it, or any man elſe can do it, is, whether the publick Prayers that are left by God and nature, to be determined by Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ought not in reaſon rather to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the prudence of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, than of Dr. <hi>O.</hi> I ſpeak of publick Prayers, which concern the honour of God, and the Edification of the Church, (not Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s or any man's private concerns at home, wherein Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and others have a liberty and property of their own, though ſubordinate to the publick good:) in which Governours have a right to ſee that all things be done decently and in order, and therefore may preſcribe ſuch Prayers as are fit for the publick Worſhip of God.

                     <p>And here farther all men ought to take notice, that though the pretence with which the poor people have been deluded hitherto has been a doubt, whether thoſe that prayed by form, prayed by the Spirit, and they have been nouriſhed up in an opinion, that <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers, or the conceived Prayers which Miniſters made of their own, did proceed from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate influence of the Spirit, whereas thoſe that did Pray according to a ſet Form printed in a Book, did offer up only hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions, and the Spirit did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who then ought to apply theſe general rules to the particular circumſtances but the Governours who have power to rebuke and chaſtiſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender if he do not obſerve ſuch decency and order as ſhall be thought meet? And ſince we are to take the Laws of nature for our guide, the common conſent of mankind have generally agreed that 'tis the Law of nature, that Governours in all Societies ſhould determine the modes and circumſtances of all publick affairs; and the ſame light of nature does teach, that thoſe circumſtances are moſt proper to be obſerved, which cuſtom and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſage have lead men unto, therefore what is thought moſt honourable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the greateſt reverence amongſt men, ought with the ſame parity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be underſtood to ſignifie our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God. And the imitating ſuch cuſtomary wayes of ſhewing reſpect, is approved by God himſelf. Thus when
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152722:48"/>God appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, God requires him to come near with all Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and in token thereof, it being the way of approaching to great Perſons in that Country, to put off his Shoes, for the place where thou ſtandeſt is Holy ground, but that being not now a cuſtom of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in uſe amongſt us, but putting off the Hat, that we ought to do inſtead thereof, when we ſpeak to God, or appear in his Houſe, where we ought to have all awful thoughts, and by our outward behaviour teſtifie our honour of him, for whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it is ſet apart.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152722:49"/>our ſelves by Faſting and Prayer, and theſe the lawful Paſtors may appoint. And ſince they have appointed thoſe which the Chriſtian Church has generally obſerved in all Ages, there can be no ground to except againſt their obſervance; and under the title of place, order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will come in all the other uſages which Diſſenters take offence at. Such as the Habit the Miniſter wears, whether Surplice or a Gown, or any other badge the Church ſhall appoint. The part of the Church where he officiates, ſo as it be where the People can Hear, as Baptiſm at the Font, reading Morning and Evening Prayer in the Desk, and the Communion Service at the Table where that Holy Sacrament is uſually Adminiſtred. And laſtly, by the ſame Principle we muſt allow of the duty of Kneeling at Prayers, and at the receiving of the Sacrament, ſtanding up at the Creeds and Hymns, and ſuch other accidents of Reverence and humble behaviour while we are in God's Houſe. For theſe in themſelves are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, being no where prohibited by God, and therefore Rulers who are to be obeyed in all lawful commands, muſt be obeyed in theſe alſo.</p>

When Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> himſelf ſayes, <hi>Nor are they capable to be otherwiſe stated, but as they lye in the light of nature, and Spiritual prudence directed by the general rules of Scripture.</hi> And ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Church, State, and Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he does moreover acknowledge, <hi>Where men have a common intereſt, they ought to conſult in common for the due management of it.</hi> And is it not the common intereſt of the Nation, to preſerve Order, Peace and Holineſs amongſt all the Members thereof, who muſt have mutual intercourſe and Communion one with another? and does it not much conduce to theſe ends, when they are put to no doubts and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples concerning their Religious duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they find the ſame order, the ſame Rules of Worſhip, the ſame Prayers and Sacraments, in whatſoever Church or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh they remove unto?

                     <p>THe other Rites which are uſually call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ceremonies of the Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly come under the notion of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Worſhip, which muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in general of neceſſity, and 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any publick Divine Service ſhould be without them, and therefore I have conſidered them all together by themſelves, for there muſt be time, place, mode, order, geſture and habit. But though the ſign of the Croſs may be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word circumſtance alſo, yet it is not of that nature, but that Religious Worſhip may be performed without any thing of that kind, and often is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſpeak of it by it ſelf, as being of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration.</p>
                     <p>But though the ſign of the Croſs does not come in under the neceſſary circumſtances of Worſhip, yet it is a thing that may be neceſſary to be obſerved when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and in its own nature highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to Chriſtian Edification. For if it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152722:52"/>does give us to underſtand, and help to keep in our minds thoſe neceſſary duties, which we muſt never forget, certainly it muſt be very uſeful to retain ſuch an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>Now that Signs are obvious to every man's apprehenſion, and apt to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, when words are forgotten; is ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that many will make Signs of their own, to put them in mind of things, which they fear they ſhould otherwiſe forget, as tyeing ſometimes a ſtring to their Fingers, knitting knots in their Handkerchiefs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are not naturally ſignificative of the things they would remember. And why we might not uſe Signs to help our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about Spiritual things, I do not ſee, ſince they are more apt to ſlip out of the minds of common people, than other matters, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided care be taken that theſe ſigns be not many, troubleſome, and impertinent, for words themſelves are but Signs, and if I can have an eaſier and more ſignificative Sign, to help my memory, and expreſs my mind, than words are; I do not ſee the leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I may not uſe it. Now, that the uſe of the Croſs is a plain, eaſie, and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sign of our profeſſion, of our belief in a crucified Saviour, and of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, willingly to take up and bear his Croſs, and no ſhort words can be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152722:52"/>of them, or ſo firmly imprint it upon our Memories, muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all mankind. For when a hundred Sermons about it would have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or little thought of, the ſeeing a Child ſigned with a Croſs when he is Baptized, will ſtir up in the dulleſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, a remembrance of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, who was crucified for them, though no diſcourſe be made about it, and ſo likewiſe in the midſt of all their Croſſes and Afflictions it will put them in mind, that theſe things are no other than they did voluntarily promiſe to undergo when they were made Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and no other than their Lord himſelf did ſuffer, and tell them they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in his Service during their Pilgrimage in this World. Who has alſo given us this aſſurance, if we patiently ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him in Glory, and theſe were the reaſons that moved the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to uſe the Sign of the Croſs ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and are ſufficient to warrant us to imitate their example in obſerving this ancient cuſtom; and the leaving it wholly off, cannot be without ſome offence to many perſons who read how much it was uſed in the Primitive Church.</p>
                     <p>I will ſet down Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s words concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter. In his Book of Church-Government,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152722:53"/>p. 404. <hi>Man's mind is not known to others but by Signs, but [God] hath not tyed us abſolutely to any particular ſigns. If a Confeſſion of Faith be read, and we are called to ſignifie our conſent,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>God hath not tyed us in ſuch caſes, whether we ſhall ſignifie this conſent by ſpeaking or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing our names, or by lifting up the hands, or laying it on a Book (as in Swearing) or by ſtanding up, or ſuch like. A ſufficient ſignification or profeſſiom of our minds is neceſſary; but the ſpecial Sign is left to our own or our Governments determination. — To this end and on theſe terms was the Sign of the Croſs uſed heretofore by Chriſtians, and to this end they uſed ſtanding in publick Worſhip every Lord's day, — and afterwards standing up at the Creed; as alſo adoring with their faces towards the East,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they uſed theſe only as ſignifications of their own minds, instead of words, as the Prophets of old were wont by other Signs, as well as words, to Propheſie to the People. And as</hi> Enſebius <hi>tells us, how</hi> Conſtantine <hi>meaſured the length and breadth of a man on the Earth, with his Spear, to tell the covetous how little must ſerve them (only a Grave place) after death. And I dare not condemn the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous uſe of ſuch profeſſing Signs as theſe: though the tongue be the chief instrument, yet not the only inſtrument to expreſs the mind;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152722:53"/>and though words be the ordinary Sign, yet not the only Sign: Dumb men muſt ſpeak by other Signs, and uſually more ſilent Signs are fitter for Aſſemblies, to avoid diſturbances and ſometimes more permanent Signs, (as ſubſcription, or a Stone or Pillar of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, as</hi> Joſh. 24. &amp;c.) <hi>are more deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And this is left to humane prudence,</hi> 19. <hi>And therefore I durst not have reproved any of the Ancient Christians that uſed the Sign of the Croſs, meerly as a profeſſing ſignal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſhew the Heathen and Jews about them, that they believed in a crucified Chriſt, and were not aſhamed of his Croſs.</hi> And ſince we are obliged to make the ſame profeſſion now, why may we not as well uſe the ſame Sign to do it by? And what then muſt we think of thoſe men who have gone about to abuſe the People with ſtrong Jealouſies and ſurmiſes, by the hard words of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Ceremonies, Humane Inventions, and new Sacraments. Becauſe we uſe ſuch a plain, innocent Sign, to the ſame end which the Ancients did it ſo Piouſly, in the firſt Ages of the Church. And alſo obſerve how unjuſt the complaints of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters are, when they cry out againſt the burden of Ceremonies, when we have but one innocent Ceremony, and that applyed to a man only in his Baptiſm, which is but once in his whole life. And ſee what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152722:54"/>meek, charitable, good natured Chriſtians they are, that can make ſuch an hideous outcry againſt Ceremonies and Impoſitions on this account. Never any that bare the Chriſtian name, did make more unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able clamours than theſe men do againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when ſhe does but endeavour to keep up a face of Primitive order, and ſhew her Conformity to the ancient and Catholick Church, in this and other circumſtances of Religious duties.</p>

So that unleſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unlawful be ſhewn in our Oaths and Subſcriptions, and Declarations, there can be no reaſon to except againſt them.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Of the new Impoſitions of Subſcriptions and Declarations.</head>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does in ſeveral places complain, that inſtead of any abatements and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches for accommodation, the Church has added to their Burdens, and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is made much more difficult than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now when matters come to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered, I hope I ſhall make it appear, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has the leaſt reaſon to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152722:55"/>complain of the Church in this point of any man, and the whole World muſt juſtly have accuſed her of folly, and palpable neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of her own ſafety, if ſhe had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired theſe new Declarations and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, conſidering what confuſions ſhe had newly eſcaped when theſe things were firſt required. For does not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> often tell the World they were the Conformiſts, and Epiſcopal men that raiſed firſt, and carryed on the War againſt the King and Church in the late Rebellion, but what ſort of Conformiſts were they? Such as either ſubmitted to the Government, only to overthrow it, or to get the advantage it did then afford them, or elſe did only account it tolerable, but neceſſary to be altered as ſoon as they had any power to do it; ſuch Hypocritical Conformiſts, that were ſecret Enemies, when they pretended to be boſom Friends, I believe might make up a great part of thoſe that were engaged in the late Rebellion, and muſt ſuch men alwayes paſs undiſcovered amongſt us, till they have opportunity to play over the ſame Game again, and involve the Nation in the other Twenty years Miſery and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion? Muſt we together with the Act of Oblivion, forget all ſenſe of our paſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and not ſo much as learn to be wiſe and prevent them for the time to come?
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152722:56"/>So that the very Objections they make againſt theſe Declarations and Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are juſt Reaſons before all the World, why they ought to be impoſed, for can any Government be ſecure, or any Society of men live in Peace, whoſe Members think it their duty to change it as ſoon as they are able, and uſe their utmoſt endeavour to alter the preſent Conſtitution? and theſe are the very Objections they make, that they cannot bind themſelves from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the Government as ſoon as they are able, and ought not the Church then to endeavour to Arm her ſelf againſt ſuch new diſturbances and confuſions? or what reaſon is there that ſhe ſhould admit any to be Teachers and Officers, which will not promiſe to uphold and maintain her Peace and Government, which theſe men do openly profeſs, they will change upon the firſt opportunity that is put into their hands? and to what miſerable State they will bring the Nation by that means, the late unhappy experiment will ſufficiently convince all ſober men, ſetting aſide the wickedneſs of Rebellion, Schiſm, Murder, Sacriledge, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, and Perjury, that were antecedent to their pretended Reformation. And muſt the Nation be wheedled again into the ſame ſnare, and uſe no remedies to ſecure themſelves?</p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:152722:56"/>
                        <p>And yet farther it muſt be ſaid, that theſe new Impoſitions, Declarations and Subſcriptions, are made no way neceſſary to our Communion, neither is any man required to take them, but thoſe that will do it voluntarily themſelves. But here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us, <hi>The Conformity of the Laity is made an hundred fold more difficult by the Corporation Oath and Declaration, and by the Veſtry Act,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet have we lately read the Writings with pitty and admiration, who bluſh not to tell the World that the Laity or People, are not put upon the renouncing of the Covenant.</hi> And is not this true? For where were any put to it as a condition of our Communion, and where is it required of any one man but where he pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Why, is not the Corporation Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> put upon men if they will be Officers and Veſtry men? but what need that? Who obliges them to it? Do not our College Statutes oblige all Fellows to be ſingle men? And muſt we therefore conclude our Nation does require them not to Marry; that no one can ſay; if they will continue in their Fellowſhip they muſt not Marry, but what neceſſity is there for them to keep their Fellowſhips? or who obliges them to that? ſo we may truly ſay, no man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be an Officer in a Corporation or Veſtry man, and therefore none of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152722:57"/>Laity are put upon renouncing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and theſe Impoſitions do not make their Conformity more difficult than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And if they are not pleaſed with theſe Conditions, 'tis but keeping out of thoſe places, no body will trouble them with any ſuch things, neither is it fit they ſhould be admitted into ſuch Societies, when they will make it their buſineſs to embroil and diſturb the Government all that they can.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of Re-ordination.</head>
                     <p>THough, as I have ſaid, theſe points of Re-ordination, Declaration, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, be nothing at all to the preſent debate about Schiſm in holding Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Yet to ſhew the Churches equity and moderation in theſe, as well as other matters, I will briefly vindicate her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions about them from their unjuſt complaints made in the peaceable deſign, which ſeems to be the moſt general ſenſe of the party.</p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:152722:57"/>
                     <p>Firſt, then Re-ordination we do not require, but do as much diſapprove of it, as they themſelves, all that is required, is, that we may be certain that all Churches be duely ſupplyed with Miniſters rightly ordained, and therefore the Church does think her ſelf bound, when ſhe may have choice, to admit none to officiate in her Service, but thoſe who are undoubtedly ſuch, thereby to avoid any ſcandal to others, and to prevent all doubts and ſcruples in many of her own Children, who would be much troubled, to live all their lives under ſuch a Miniſter, from whom they were not certain to receive true Sacraments, and true Miniſterial Benediction. For we can plead no neceſſity here in our caſe, and therefore that which may be tolerable in caſe of neceſſity, cannot excuſe, or be any warrant, when there is no ſuch neceſſity for it, therefore ſhe does admit none but thoſe that are Epiſcopally ordained. The caſe therefore is this, in Scripture there are three names uſed to denote the Miniſters under the Goſpel, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Theſe words do plainly now in the uſage of the Church, ſignifie other things than they did anciently in Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, therefore I do not ſee how we can know what Office does belong to each of them, and what a Biſhop, an Elder, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152722:58"/>a Deacon are to do, but from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as it has been generally underſtood in this matter. And this we muſt lay down for certain, that God did inſtitute all things in his Church, as was moſt agreeable to good order, and the peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, and therefore we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to conclude he did preſcribe thoſe methods now under the Goſpel, which he thought beſt under the Law, and which the ſober part of mankind have thought moſt expedient for the publick Peace, if nothing appear to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Now in all well conſtituted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the power of making Laws, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Controverſies, and giving judgment, is not in every particular man, but in ſome ſelect choſen Officers who are gradually one above another, and ſtill the Superior to redreſs any juſt complaint made againſt an Inferior. Thus in the Jewiſh Polity, there were three diſtinct orders of men to Miniſter about Holy things, the <hi>Levites,</hi> the Prieſts and the High Prieſt, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was Chief and above all. Now, why ſhould not the ſame reaſon hold in the Government of the Chriſtian Church? and does not the like equity appear that there ſhould be diſtinctions of orders and degrees amongſt the Rulers thereof, the lower orders keeping within their bounds,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152722:58"/>and leaving the weightier matters to thoſe of the higheſt rank? Since therefore this is after the example of the Civil Polity, 'tis according to the order of the Jewiſh Church, if Scripture will allow of it, and the Tradition of the Chriſtian Church does tell us all along ſuch a diſtinction of orders was kept up. Methinks this ſhould be enough to quiet all contentions about it.</p>
                     <p>To avoid then all ambiguity of words, as much as is poſſible, 'tis plain that there is one ſpoken of in Scripture in the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number, who has full Power and Authority to do all Offices whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and he is called Biſhop, and Elder in ſeveral places. And ſome think, that as often as the word Elder, in Scripture, does ſignifie an Officer in the Church, it is meant only of a Biſhop. Beſide the Biſhop, there is the Miniſter of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which may ſignifie the Prieſt or Presbyter in the Modern ſenſe. And then there is a third degree mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. the Miniſter that was to ſerve Tables, which may properly belong to thoſe we call Deacons at this day. So that here is the Biſhop, the Miniſter of the Word, and the Miniſter to ſerve Tables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> juſt three orders as were under the Old Teſtament, and why there ſhould be ſuch a Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation then and not now, no one can
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152722:59"/>imagine. Beſides St. <hi>Jerom</hi> does expreſly tell us in one place,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Nepot.</note> 
                        <hi>What</hi> Aaron <hi>and the Prieſts were under the Law, that were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts under the Goſpel.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Et Epiſt. ad Evagr.</note> And in another place, <hi>That we may know the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Traditions taken out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, what</hi> Aaron <hi>and the Prieſts and</hi> Levites <hi>were under the Law, that are Biſhop, Prieſts and Deacons under the Goſpel. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> who lived in the Apoſtles dayes, does plainly mention theſe three Orders of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts and Deacons; and all Ages of the Church ever ſince, to this very day, have kept up this diſtinction. So that there is ſufficient Authority for it from Scripture Tradition, and conſequently from Reaſon. This diſtinction being ſuppoſed, the end o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> diſtinction is, becauſe there may be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Offices belonging to one more than to another, and ſtill the Offices of greateſt truſt and difficulty, are committed to the Higheſt Order. Now becauſe the matter of Ordination and appointing Miniſters of determining Controverſies about Hereſie and Schiſm, preſcribing Rules of order and decency, are things that require the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt judgment and diſcretion, 'tis fit they ſhould be peculiar to thoſe of the higheſt order, and every one that is qualified to Miniſter in an ordinary way, and do all offices according to ſound and wholſome
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152722:59"/>Rules, is not fit to be a Judge, a Law-maker, and to preſcribe Rules, and appoint other Miniſters and Officers in the Church. And if it be not reaſonable to expect that every Miniſter ſhould be qualified for all theſe Offices, 'tis not reaſonable to ſuppoſe he has any ſuch Authority given him by God. The power therefore of Ordaining Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and ending of incident Controverſies, ought to be ſuppoſed to be committed to men that are particularly choſen for their wiſdom and gravity to judge of thoſe things, and therefore it ſeems reaſonable it ſhould be appropriated to the Biſhop, who is a ſelect perſon of more Authority than other Officers in the Church. Now we never read in Scripture, that any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination was ever made, but where one of the higheſt Order was preſent. And in that place which they ſo much urge, <hi>With the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> there was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s hands amongſt them, who could have done it alone, and theirs being, or not being there, did not alter the caſe. Neither can they ever prove, that by the Presbytery there, are meant ſuch Prieſts as ours now. The Ancient Fathers ſay they were Biſhops only. Neither does it ever appear, that any one but a Biſhop, which was accounted an Order above a Presbyter, as 'tis now underſtood, did

                     <p>So that for men, after fifteen hundred years, to begin an Office of their own heads, that was never known or heard of before, and then to cry out they are wrong'd, and have infinite hard meaſure, that all will not joyn with them in ſuch a novelty and groundleſs invention, is to me the ſtrongeſt boldneſs, and unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that men can lightly be guilty of.</p>

And for his pretended Arguments drawn from Reaſon or Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they are all fully anſwered in this Diſcourſe, and conſequently Re-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not required by our Church, but ſufficient Teſtimony of ſuch true and real Ordination as the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do produce.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Declaration of Aſſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</head>
                     <p>THE next thing excepted againſt is, <hi>The Declaration of Aſſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to all and every thing contained and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152722:64"/>preſcribed in, and by the Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Againſt this they object, <hi>How can thoſe now whoſe judgments are, and have been ſtill for Moderation between both Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in times before as now be able to come over to one ſide altogether, on ſuch terms as theſe? How can theſe we ſay make ſo ſhort a turn as this, without the hazzard of ſome ſprain to their Conſciences if they do it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that to do any thing that tends to Peace and Settlement, muſt preſently be a ſprain to your Conſciences. One would have thought the renouncing of former Oaths and Subſcriptions of Canonical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bience, joyning to overturn the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Church and State, and now plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Indulgence and Toleration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all your former Reaſons and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations againſt it, ſhould be a greater ſprain than to return to your duty, and make ſatisfaction for the injury you had done; but to put your Conſciences quite out of joynt for Schiſm and Faction, is not half ſo much as a little twitch to bring it them to their right place, when they have ſtarted aſide. But who deſires you to ſprain your Conſciences in this matter? I do not ſee any reaſon that men ſhould be ſo fond of your coming in, if you are not inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved to take the Miniſterial Office upon you, with the like Conformity that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152722:64"/>others do profeſs, you have free liberty to continue as you are, for God be thanked neither the neceſſities, nor the honour of the Church does ſtand in need of ſuch mens labours. But as for your Reaſons againſt this Declaration, they are ſo far from moving us, that they were the very motives that made it neceſſary to require it. For we have ſeen enough by experience, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs come from ſuch luke-warm Teachers, and how little hopes there was like to be of Settlement, unleſs the Clergy were hearty and ſerious in the Service of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo did effectually ſtir up the People to Zeal and Concord in the ſame Worſhip. Now this can never be expected when the Miniſters themſelves are not well ſatisfied with it, but are always hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after changes and alterations, and are ſo far from exhorting the People to Devout Submiſſion and Conformity, that they are alwayes inſinuating the unlawfulneſs and the Imperfection of their preſent Religious Offices, and thereupon would read the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer as they would read a Brief, or a Proclamation, never regarding whether it were true or falſe, and ſhew no Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all about it. The Church of <hi>England</hi> therefore, under the deep ſenſe ſhe had of God's honour and Service, and to the end ſhe might as much as in her lay, promote
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152722:65"/>Piety and Devotion in the performance of her publick Worſhip, did take care to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit none to officiate therein, but ſuch as without Hypocriſie and Guile, and with an unfeigned heart, would Aſſent to the truth and uſefulneſs of her publick Service, that ſo they might encourage others piouſly to frequent that, which they had declared to be good and acceptable in the ſight of God.</p>
                     <p>For can it ever be reaſonable to admit men to officiate in that Service, and have the inſtruction of the People in the right underſtanding and Praying according to it, when they themſelves do at the ſame time think it not pleaſing to God? So that if the Common-Prayer-Book be an Order of Worſhip which is pleaſing to God, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> does believe, ſhe ought likewiſe to take care that thoſe that officiate in it do not mock God, and offer the Sacrifice of Fools, as they muſt do, if they think they offend God in officiating according to it. But if they think it all agreeable to the mind and will of God, and ſuch as he will accept at their hands, why may they not declare their Aſſent and Conſent unto the ſame? However, the Church could never juſtifie her ſelf before God or men, if ſhe ſhould permit men to offer up a Service to God Almighty,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152722:65"/>which they did think was contrary to his will.</p>
                     <p>But ſome will farther ſay, there are ſome Rubricks inſerted into the Common-Prayer which are no part of the Service, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine controverted points, in which many are not well ſatisfied, and yet are obliged to Aſſent to them.</p>
                     <p>The Catechiſm is alſo a part of the Book and with good reaſon, and if there be other Doctrines as that about the efficacy of Baptiſm, and Antiquity of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, they are very uſeful truths alſo, and fit to be taught in theſe diſtracting times, and therefore 'tis reaſonable that the Teachers ſhould declare their Aſſent to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick truth about them. For a Church muſt not forgo all profitable truths, becauſe ſome men bred up under Factious and Schiſmatical Teachers, have had wrong notions about them, but ought the rather to take care that men be better inſtructed about them, and therefore that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at leaſt make a profeſſion thereof. But if we muſt leave out every thing that ſome will call controverted, we ſhall pare away all our Religion. And yet I dare ſay, theſe truths have been as little contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in the Chriſtian Church as any, and are alſo of very great advantage, and much
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152722:66"/>tending to the Peace of the Church that they ſhould be aſſented to, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Book of Common-Prayer.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſeveral Objections againſt the Rubricks and Calendars, and ſeveral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, there is no more deſigned nor intended in our Aſſent and Conſent to them, but that the orders and manner of Service preſcribed by them, may be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and religiouſly obſerved, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the ſubſtantial parts of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip performed according to thoſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and commands, will be acceptable and well pleaſing in his ſight. So that we may Praiſe God according to the <hi>Engliſh Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> obſerve <hi>Eaſter</hi> according to the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, read all the Leſſons, obſerve the Feſtivals, and other Rites and Ceremonies preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in and by the ſaid Book, with a very good Conſcience. Whether ſome Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations might not be made, is not defined nor declared either way, but our Aſſent and Conſent is to what now is preſcribed, and does require no more than to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we lawfully and piouſly may follow theſe directions.</p>
                     <p>Thus becauſe Aſtronomical Tables dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and the motions of the Moon do vary, ſo that 'tis hard for to find out the certain moment of the Moons changes, therefore
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152722:66"/>the Church has ordered, that ſhe will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Eaſter</hi> according to the direction ſet down in her Calendar. Now whether that does alwayes fall out directly according to the Critical point in Aſtronomy is not material, neither does the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ſo much, but has ſet down a Rule, how to find out the firſt Full Moon after the one and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> and becauſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it falls out ſo, the rule is well enough, and when it happens to fail from the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Moons motion, yet it may ſerve for the determination of the Churches <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which is all that is intended by it.</p>
                     <p>The only Objection that I find material is, the Aſſent to the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, as it ſtands now with the Addition of <hi>Filio<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan>
                        </hi> which they ſay does ſeem to condemn all the Greek Church, who oppoſe that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, if they rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the words of the Creed, they will ſee no neceſſity to infer any ſuch Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For the words are, <hi>This is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, which except a man believe Faithfully, he cannot be ſaved.</hi> Now to be faithful in any thing, does ſuppoſe it to be committed to his truſt, and to believe a thing faithfully, is to believe it in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as 'tis committed to him. Now the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152722:67"/>Church of God in general, nor the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular, has no where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the Addition of the word <hi>Filioque,</hi> or the expreſs meaning thereof, is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, neither do we condemn the Greek Church, though they differ from us about it. So that this point being not abſolutely committed any where as indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe words <hi>Which except a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve faithfully,</hi> are not to be extended, to condemn all thoſe that do not explicitly Aſſent to that Addition. Neither do thoſe words mean, that all that do not explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know and believe that Creed, cannot be ſaved. But all thoſe, that when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Churches Faith declared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, do reject and deny it. For to believe a thing faithfully, does ſuppoſe that it is propoſed to a man with all its Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Circumſtances, and then whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does not believe the Catholick Faith, faithfully, without doubt ſhall periſh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly. And that this has been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant meaning of the Church is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was never taught young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their Catechiſm, nor the profeſſion thereof exacted of Sick and dying perſons, which would have been done, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite belief of every paſſage had been thought neceſſary to Salvation. But yet
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152722:67"/>becauſe it is very uſeful to be underſtood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>herefore it is put into the Liturgy, that Pious men may know and conſider it, and becauſe it ought not to be denyed when it is underſtood, therefore the Creed does very well ſay, this is the Catholick Faith, which, <hi>Except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be ſaved.</hi> For it declares no other Doctrine, but what is actually contained in the Apoſtles and <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed.</p>

The Poſition then that they are to hold traiterous is, taking up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the known undoubted Will of the King, and where we are ſure the Perſons are commiſſionated by him.

                     <p>I acknowledge the King has ſeveral Councellors and Judges under him, and if one gives him wrong advice, and decrees all judgment, he may appoint another to examine the matter and amend the former miſtake, and ſuch is the Juſtice of our Kings and Laws, that they allow a remedy againſt any error or ſurpriſe, and therefore can grant a Superſedeas to proceedings till far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination.</p>

And farther, though the King be ſworn to maintain the Law, yet he is not bound to follow the opinion of every Judge and Lawyer, for they all act by and under him; there is no doubt therefore, but the King will conſider what he does, before he grants his Commiſſion, and will hearken to ſuch
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152722:72"/>advice as he finds moſt agreeable to the Law, and thereupon will ſuſpend all other Executions and Commiſſions.

                        <hi>I abhor this traiterous Poſition, they are harſh.</hi> If the thing it ſelf be horrid, ought not the words that declare it ſo to be, harſh alſo? But why is it harſh, to ſay I abhor that which is ſo odious and abominable in the ſight of God and men?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.23.</note> 
                        <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft.</hi> And therefore if Grave Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> was offended at that expreſſion, it is a ſign he was not ſo judicious or ſo honeſt a man as theſe men would have the World believe, for if Rebellion be evil as it is, and to promiſe all hearty obedience, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubjection to our Governours be good, nay 'tis our duty, then we may ſurely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offence, <hi>abhor that which is evil,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152722:73"/>and cleave to that which is good.</hi> And it will be our duty to profeſs ſo much when we are called thereunto, to give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Governours, and ſecurity to the publick Peace.</p>
                     <p>Another great ſtumbling block, as they pretend, is the Renouncing the Covenant, now that is propoſed in the moſt moderate terms that can conſiſt with the publick Peace. For all by-matters about it are paſt over in ſilence, and they are only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to declare, <hi>There lyes no Obligation on me, or any other perſon, from the Oath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the ſolemn League and Covenant, to endeavour any change of Government either in Church or State.</hi> Now when the Kingdom had ſmarted ſo many years under this wicked Conſpiracy, when a great part of the Nation did ſtill inſiſt upon that pretence to move new changes and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances amongſt us, how could we ever expect Peace and Settlement, if ſuch men were admitted to be Preachers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, that thought they lay under an Obligation, to bring us back unto the like confuſion again? Nay, this ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moved the <hi>Scots</hi> to Rebel lately, and even now at this time many of them ſtand in defiance of the Government; upon the ſame grounds of purſuing their Covenant, ſo that when the thing it ſelf is wicked, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:152722:73"/>it has been the cauſe of ſo much miſchief already, and is a conſtant pretence for new Commotions; 'tis not only lawful, but neceſſary to require men to renounce ſuch dangerous Principles, for though ſome men may have erroneous opinions concerning theſe matters, that may be born withall while they keep them to themſelves, yet when they are vented to cauſe Schiſms and Factions, to diſturb the Peace and Unity of the Church, and ſtir up Rebellions in the State, and men fall to murder and deſtroy thoſe that withſtand ſuch Innovations, 'tis fitting that not only thoſe that are admitted to any Office, but even all private Chriſtians that had been engaged in ſuch a dangerous Conſpiracy, ſhould declare their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for, and abhorrence of all ſuch Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Principles, and indeed the Nation ſeems to have been rather wanting herein; in the ancient Church, thoſe that had been engaged in any Schiſm, were put to Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and an open acknowledgment of their ſin.</p>
                     <p>Now let all ſober and peaceable minded men, conſider our caſe in ſhort. This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had been governed by Kings and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops for 1600 years, and was as happy and pure a Church as any in the World, and upon certain wicked Principles carried on out of Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Envy,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152722:74"/>and Revenge, there was raiſed a Rebellion and Schiſm with lamentable Murders and Deſolations for near twenty years, and our King himſelf driven away from his own juſt Rights by his wicked Subjects, after it pleaſed God to reſtore him, and the Nation to their ancient Liberties and Poſſeſſions, what could be more juſt and reaſonable, than to re-eſtabliſh the Church and State in that Government, under which they had continued 1600 years before, and to the end that they might not be again diſturbed, to require all Preachers and Governours to declare they would not endeavour any alteration of the Government either in the Church or State, and to promiſe that they will heartily and ſincerely conform to the preſent Conſtitution, and endeavour to ſupport and maintain it: Does not every Society and Corporation require the like?</p>
                     <p>And yet theſe are the main Objections brought againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the ground upon which the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts pretend they are forced to hold up theſe ſeparate Congregations. And when they give the reaſons of their diſlike, they all at length amount to no more than this, they have been bred up in Rebellion and Schiſm, and harboured ill Principles of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And they are not ſatisfied that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152722:74"/>they can with a ſafe conſcience renounce them. But they neither ſhew Reaſon or Scripture, or Tradition of the Church, againſt the preſent Conſtitutions, but hug their own erroneous opinions, contrary to them all. And whereas they farther plead the Obligation they have to preach and uphold ſeparate Meetings, by reaſon of the great benefit the Nation receiveth from their Inſtruction, and the advantage not to ſay the neceſſity of a Toleration upon that account. I would wiſh them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, which all others are fully ſatisfied of, that this is the ready way to deſtruction and to bring in all confuſion, elſe why ſhould the Papiſts ſo much promote this way, as is evident they do, by inſinuating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſuch ſeparate Congregations? Nay, has not a little Diſcourſe called <hi>Foxes and Fire-brands</hi> ſhewn demonſtratively, that the Papiſts firſt ſet a foot theſe cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> under pretence of greater purity, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Condeſcention to tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? Did not they chiefly procure that Declaration of Indulgence, which Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo much commend? Had not <hi>Coleman</hi> prepared a draught for another, and are we not at this day ſenſible, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand too well what is for the carrying on of their own Faction, and our Unſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:152722:75"/>Did we not viſibly ſee that all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Schiſms, Tumults and Diſorders did more increaſe in one year under the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, than in many before, though the Laws were ſtill in force to reſtrain them? And have not the Followers of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles rolled from Schiſm to Hereſie, to Atheiſm, to Popery, to any thing, and is there not Forty for one of theſe Sectaries, more now than there were in 1630. before theſe greater Edifiers fell a building their new way? Nay, are not theſe Godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (as they call themſelves) upon any trouble or difficulty that lyes upon the State, alwayes adding fuell to the flame, and by their inſolent words, againſt the King and Government, rude affronts to the Gentry and Clergy, and violent threats and holding up of Clubs againſt their quiet neighbours, in all Elections and publick Meetings, do they not plainly ſhew that their hearts and their hands are as ready for a new Rebellion, as they were in 40 or 41. and what miſchiefs muſt we expect, if theſe proceedings ſhould be incouraged by a Law for Toleration, and our Church ſhould be filled with ſuch men, that think it their duty, upon the firſt opportunity, to deſtroy it? Men that have ſouls to ſave, and lives of their own, and have Wives and Children, and Eſtates to looſe, would do
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152722:75"/>well to look back, and then think, if the ſame Principles, and the ſame tumultuous Methods, will not bring the ſame deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Nation, if publickly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

Therefore, if there be any Rubricks and Circumſtances in the Churches Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that ſome people may miſunderſtand, and interpret farther than they were ever intended by the Church, or any overſight or miſtake which with a little Explanation might be amended, I think it very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the perſons who deſire to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ſhould apply themſelves to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and that they ſhould endeavour to remove ſuch ſcruples.</p>

                     <p>So that the upſhot of this peaceable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is, to bring in all confuſion and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion inſtead of a well conſtituted and truly Catholick Church. For whereas now at preſent the publick Authority of the Kingdom, has ſufficiently ſhewed its care of the true Religion, and made ſtrict Laws, and appointed Governours to ſee them executed, that righteouſneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might flouriſh in our Kingdom; theſe Presbyterians, that they might gain their own ends, perſwade the Governours to abandon all care of true Religion, and leave men to ſerve God how they pleaſe, or elſe not at all; for let Atheiſts ſay they are Diſſenters, and they then are not to be troubled, ſo that from one of the beſt and happieſt Churches in the World, we are to have none at all by publick Authority. Becauſe every one is to be leſt to follow his own fancy, without any Obligation to any Eccleſiaſtical Authority, and ſo it will be no thanks to the Government, that there is any ſuch thing as Religion amongſt us. See therefore the blindneſs of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whither Schiſm and Separation lead men. Is all their Contentions about Ceremonies come to this, that every one muſt be permitted to do as he liſt, rather than they ſhould be denyed their humour? Is all their Oppoſition to Popery, Zeal for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152722:80"/>the glory of God, and Contention for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Worſhip, turned to Libertiniſm and downright madneſs? Surely time was, when Presbyterians had another Spirit, and did highly abominate ſuch dangerous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane notions, but when once men forſake God's wayes, he gives them up to ſtrange deluſions.</p>
                     <p>But ſome will ſay I run the matter too high againſt them, they are not for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Toleration, but ſuch as <hi>is conſiſtent with the Articles of Faith,</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Creed</hi>) <hi>a good life, and the Government of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Theſe are very good Limitations, if they were rightly and fully underſtood, but as theſe men mean in the whole drift of their Book, are ſuch large Conditions, as will take in any Heretick and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick almoſt in the World, that has but the common prudence of a man to ſave his skin; to be ſure all <hi>Pelagians, Socinians, Anabaptiſts, Quakers,</hi> will come in for a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, as well as <hi>Presbyterians, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they do all profeſs the Creed, that is, the Apoſtles Creed in their own ſenſe, and pretend to a good life, that is, ſoberly to follow that Doctrine which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and at preſent declare to be for the Secular Government of the Nation. But to believe the Apoſtles Creed, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:152722:80"/>in the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian,</hi> and moſt Churches in the World, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as well as others, do profeſs it; to lead a good life, that is in Conformity to the Laws of God and Man, and to ſubmit to the Government of the Nation, that is, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, as it is now eſtabliſhed; that neither Presbyterians nor Independants, nor Papiſts, nor Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do profeſs to do: ſo that not only Papiſts, but all Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that now appear in the World, are to be left to their own liberty, and paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, in order to this peaceable deſign, and prevent the coming in of Popery. Now is this not the very deſign that the Papiſts themſelves carry on? Do not they deſire, and earneſtly ſtrive after this, as the firſt point to be gained, the better to unhinge men from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and take them off from all ſettled and conſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? one would have thought therefore, this was rather a Popiſh than a Presbyterian Deſign.</p>
                     <p>Let the World therefore underſtand, who 'tis that are for favouring Papiſts, and encouraging them to continue in their Schiſm and Superſtition, not the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that does Enact Laws and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties againſt them, but the Presbyterians, who would have theſe Laws taken away,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152722:81"/>and leave them <hi>to the enjoyment of their Conſcience without any trouble.</hi> And yet it muſt be confeſſed, that here they ſhew ſome Logick and Ingenuity, and plainly own the conſequence, that 'tis fit ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhould be allowed the Papiſts, as they would have given themſelves, and the ſame common rule of Chriſtianity ought to be uſed towards them, <hi>That we muſt do as we would be done by, to all men,</hi> p. 33. Since therefore it is their own Argument, that one ought to be dealt with like the other. I may hence rather infer, that ſince Papiſts ought not to be let go without puniſhment, but all reaſonable care and means muſt be uſed to bring them to the truth, and to hearken to ſound Inſtruction; by the ſame Law, Presbyterians ought to be dealt with in like manner, that they may be reduced to the unity of the Church.</p>
                     <p>For though I am not neither for loving Capital puniſhments, or Cruel torments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, yet, ſeeing they err from the Truth, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrates ought to be a terror to ſuch evil doers, and take care that all their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Subjects yield obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel. This is provided for, by ſeveral Conſtitutions in the body of the Imperial Laws, and conſtantly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in all Chriſtian Kingdoms and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152722:81"/>and by theſe means the diſturbers of the Churches Unity, have been much ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. But theſe Presbyterians, though they profeſs the Pariſh-Churches are true Churches, and there now lyes an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a very ſtrict tye, to engage all men to Communicate with them, and ſerve God in a true Church, yet that they may be gratified in their own imaginations, would have all theſe motives taken away, and men left to be <hi>Pelagians, Anabaptiſts, Quakers, Socinians</hi> or <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and ſo Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of no Church at all.</p>
                     <p>But this is but only for Seven years, p. 44. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil by another Act of Parliament or a Convocation, thoſe that are fit to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, and the intolerable be diſtingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that for Seven years they would have no publick Religion vindicated and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Nation, and by that time they may think, when Hell has been let looſe ſo long to rage amongſt us, and men for Seven years have lived without any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Controul, they ſhall have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured up the people into the ſame humour that they were of in 41. and have made their Party ſo ſtrong, that they can give Law to the Nation, and then they begin to talk of a Convocation. Hitherto it is only the Parliament muſt do all, till they can get
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152722:82"/>ſuch a Head as to model a Parliament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own humour. But after Seven years confuſion to Arm themſelves, then we hear of a Convocation again, and Liberty of Conſcience muſt be taken away, I ſuppoſe, when a Presbyterian Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall enjoyn the Covenant again, and ſhall turn out of Houſe and Home all that will not take it, and ſo diſtinguiſh thoſe that are fit to be tolerated, and the Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. Here then they follow the Maxim of the Papiſts, as in many other things. When the Government is againſt them, then all Penal Statutes muſt be taken away, and 'tis all the reaſon, that men ſhould be permitted to enjoy the Liberty of their Conſcience, though all Hereticks and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts be allowed upon the ſame Principle; but when they are uppermoſt, and have the Power in their hands, then all are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants and Intolerable, that do not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their Errors and Novelties. So that Religion, and Peace, and Order, may ſink or ſwim, if they have their own Wills, 'tis all one to them, for they cannot but know, when all Penal Laws are taken away, that compel men to live in obedience to ſound Religion, and Diſſenters left to try their tricks amongſt them, the humour of the Common People will quickly lead them into the by-Paths of error, and not long
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152722:82"/>after to mind no Religion at all, that ſo they may follow their Luſts and Pleaſures with leſſer check and controul. But theſe are no inconveniences with them, but may be all ſwallowed, if Presbyterians be but gratified by it.</p>

Lo here, away opened for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152722:83"/>(if they pleaſe) to rid the trouble and ſcruple of Schiſm at once out of the Land.</hi> But what ſhall become of the crime and guilt of Schiſm all this while? Can the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rid that out of the Land too? If they could do that too it were brave, and then the motion ought to be conſidered. But if the ſin of Schiſm will ſtill remain, 'tis fit the ſcruple ſhould continue to keep ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from running into it. And 'tis fit the trouble alſo ſhould remain, that thoſe that are actually engaged in it, may be induced to repent, which many Worldly-minded and ambitious men would never think of, if they are permitted to indulge their own humours, without any trouble and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. <hi>But in their affliction they will ſeek me early,</hi> Hoſ. 5.15.</p>
                     <p>But can the Parliament take Schiſm out of the Land? How and which way? If they would remove all ſuch Schiſmatical Teachers as theſe, that blow the Trumpet to Schiſm and Sedition, and carefully ſee their own Laws moderately executed, that they have made to take away Separation, and bring men to Peace and Unity, that is a likely way indeed; and we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that when the State has appeared to put theſe Laws in Execution, our Churches have been preſently thronged, and moſt men have thought of returning to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152722:83"/>their duty. This was viſible a little after His Majeſties Reſtauration, and a little before the late Indulgence in 71. but as ſoon as that came out, how were Sects increaſed, Schiſms multiplied? Men that had lived in all obedience and Conformity before, then thought it a fine thing to Rove and Ramble up and down from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle to Conventicle, from Sect to Sect, and were pleaſed with the novelty and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs that they had got. So that this Propoſal of Toleration, is not only a means to encourage thoſe that are already engaged in Schiſm, to continue ſo, but by experience is found the moſt effectual way to multiply new ſwarms of Schiſmaticks, and to draw away all the ignorant and unſtable (which are not a few) into God knows what miſeries and diſtractions. But that is no inconvenience to them, ſo long as they can have their own ends, and ruine the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which this bugbear word Schiſm does much hinder them to do. Hereſie they can turn off with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and Atheiſm may be concealed. But <hi>Schiſm</hi> and Diſobedience, contrary to an Act of Parliament, are ſuch terrible Scarecrows, that <hi>Engliſh</hi> men cannot ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down without ſome trouble and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore they would fain have the Obligation of the Act of Parliament
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:152722:84"/>taken away. And for the Obligation of the Goſpel, that they could manage well enough, and tell the People twenty Stories and Devices to wipe off their troubles and ſcruples about it.</p>
                     <p>Yet farther, are theſe men Divines and Schollars that talk after this manner? Who ever did account it Schiſm in the Goſpel ſenſe, and as the word is now uſed amongſt Chriſtians, to diſobey the unjuſt commands of the Civil Magiſtrate? Were Chriſt and his Apoſtles Schiſmaticks? Were all the Primitive Chriſtians Schiſmaticks till <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>'s time? Nay, were there not Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks all that while the Church was a Society that had Laws and Government contrary to the Laws of the Secular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? For does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> that there were Schiſms amongſt them, and do we not find the <hi>Novatians</hi> accounted Schiſmaticks, and many others long before <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time? Nay more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, were not the <hi>Arians</hi> Schiſmaticks, under the Reign of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> though they had the Edicts of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to favour them, which were then of as good Authority as our Acts of Parliament are now with us? Or if we ſhould ever have a Popiſh Parliament, that ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to go to Maſs, and aboliſh our preſent Conſtitutions, ſhould we be Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:152722:84"/>for not obeying them? I hope not, there's no ſuch matter. Theſe men much miſtake the nature of a Church, and the Conſtitution of our Kingdom. Chriſt has Paſtors and Teachers in his Church, and has promiſed to be with them to the end of the World, and commanded all good Chriſtians to obey them, and as they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the commands of Chriſt, and their own Salvation, ſo they muſt live in the Obedience and Communion of theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; this theſe men know very well, and can plead and urge it when time is, and therefore their Schiſm is not formally in diſobeying the Act of Parliament, but in ſeparating from the Unity and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, which did ſubſiſt before the Magiſtrates favoured it, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue again, though Kings and Parliaments ſhould leave off to Protect it; and men would be Schiſmaticks notwithſtanding that ſhould in ſuch a caſe ſeparate from her Communion. Kings may dye or be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, (From the hands of all Traytors and Murderers, God preſerve them) and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments may turn Rebellious and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſe, at leaſt may vary from their former Piety, but <hi>Chriſt liveth for evermore,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> he is <hi>the ſame yeſterday and to day, and for ever,</hi>

                     <p>And as Chriſt has inſtituted Governours in his Church, and promiſed his perpetual continuance with, and preſervation of them, ſo the Conſtitution of our Kingdom does reſerve to the Church, all that right which Chriſt has given her, and the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all our priviledges begins thus, <hi>We have granted unto God, and by this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Charter have confirmed for us and for our Heirs for ever, that the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>ſhall be Free, and enjoy all her whole rights and liberties inviolable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And even before the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf, in <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the Biſhops and Paſtors had the Government of this Church, which they derived from Chriſt, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were bound to obey them as his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and all that Kings and Parliaments have done ſince, is by way of Cumulation, and adding the Authority of the Civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to the Churches Conſtitutions, and obliging men under Temporal Penalties to yield obedience to the Church, ſo that if theſe were again taken away, the Church would ſtill have that Authority which Chriſt had given her, and men would be Schiſmaticks that ſhould withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152722:85"/>from the Communion and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe Miniſters which Chriſt has ſet over them.

                     <p>AFter they have laid the Foundation of Diſorder and Confuſion, ſo as to deſtroy the Church it ſelf, they proceed to make a Propoſal to the Parliament, to ruine and ſtarve many of the Orthodox and conformable Clergy, and diſable others from being ſo uſeful and ſerviceable to the Church and Nation as now they are, that the Non-conformiſts may have better means and advantages to haſten the Churches deſtruction, that is, by taking away all Pluralities, and ſetling the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Non-conformiſts upon their own terms, in vacant places, p. 43. Now alterations of this nature do not uſe to be made to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:152722:87"/>diſpoſſeſs men of their preſent Poſſeſſions, which muſt needs prove very miſchievous to many who upon the conſidence of ſuch a right they had, have entered into many Covenants and Obligations, that it will prove to their great damager if not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter undoing, to be deprived of it. But if it be thought convenient to change ſuch a thing, it is by making it unlawful for any to have the like Diſpenſation hereafter, but at preſent to let perſons quietly to enjoy what they poſſeſs. But in this Propoſal an honeſt, pious, learned and conformable Curate, that has with great pains brought his Pariſh to be pious and peaceable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, muſt be turned out to the wide World, and a Non-conformiſt, that has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ived in diſobedience and Schiſm, perhaps was a great Incendiary in the late Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had never any Regular Ordination, muſt be put in, and yet theſe poor People muſt have no other to Adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to them, and have the direction of their ſouls, when perhaps they are not ſatisfied that he is a Miniſter at all. This is ſetting Wolves over the Lambs, and Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards over Kids, and the ready method to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut a Non-conformiſt into the Church, and the honeſt Conformiſt into a Barn. Surely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f Pluralities are to be taken away, 'tis fit the honeſt and able Curate ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:152722:88"/>in the Charge, and not be expoſed to Starve; and that People ſhould have a Miniſter of whoſe Ordination and ſound Doctrine they are ſatisfied of, and who has been approved and licenſed by the Biſhop as the Laws of God and Man do require, but it ſeems to be very hard, that an un-ordained Incendiary, ſhould be put into a conformable and orderly Pariſh, without the approbation and Licenſe of the Biſhop, or that a Biſhop ſhould be obliged to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a man that does not conform to the orders of the Convocation.</p>
                     <p>But then as for Pluralities themſelves, as they are now permitted, I do not ſee that they are for the prejudice, but many wayes for the great advantage of the Church, and none that do not run into the wild Notions of Independency, I think can have any reaſon to ſpeak againſt them, as they are bounded by the preſent Laws. For Chriſtians being Baptized into the Faith of the Catholick Church, they are to remember they muſt live and act as parts of that one Body, and therefore profeſs the Faith and keep the Unity thereof, ſo that they muſt not follow their particular Miniſter, but as he does direct them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of the Church. Which is the order and method which Chriſt himſelf has appointed. 1. That the Church
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152722:88"/>Univerſal, or the body of Paſtors in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſhould take care to condemn all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and quiet all Schiſms that might lead people into danger, the national Church ſhould accommodate theſe rules to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of each Kingdom or Government, the Provincial Church does yet more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide for the orderly execution of theſe rules, and the Biſhop with his Prieſts and Deacons, do more particularly apply all theſe orders to the ſeveral circumſtances of each private Chriſtian's duty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and after this manner is our Church now conſtituted, and thereby the greateſt and moſt immediate care for the applying of all theſe rules, does lye upon the Biſhop and the Prieſts under him. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal care indeed lyes upon the Biſhop, for he is not only to look to the people that they do their duty, but to the good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of the Prieſts alſo; and therefore he ought in the firſt place, if any, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but he can have no reaſon to be aggrieved at it, for he by the advantage of Pluralities, can commit the charge of the People to two able and faithful men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of one only, and compel them both to do their duty. And ought not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in reaſon to preſume, that a grave learned man having the inſpection over a Pariſh, together with a younger hopeful
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152722:89"/>perſon, is like to ſee matters more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally managed for the good of the people, than if it were wholly left to the young man alone?</p>
                     <p>Neither can the people have any reaſon to complain, for by the mutual eaſe and help they will give one another, they may both have the more leaſure to follow their Study, and improve in knowledge, and alſo be more at liberty to attend the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of their Flocks. And certainly 'tis much more for the peoples benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to have the care and inſtruction of a more grave and experienced man, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their young Curate, than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to take a man as they find him, and be tyed to him for forty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any variety or relief in caſe he ſhould prove Weak, Negligent, or Factious.</p>
                     <p>So that all the reaſon of complaint, if there be any at all, muſt be in the Curates themſelves, and younger Clergy, who might ſome of them, hope to be Rectors, if Pluralities were taken away, whereas now they are only Curates. But the complaint is not laid here, nay, they are not thought worthy of any conſideration at all, but are to be turned out like Dogs to ſtarve, after all their honeſt pains and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Non-conformiſts are to diſpoſſeſs
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152722:89"/>both the Rector and Curate. But perhaps ſome would think they are only out in that Propoſal, and if the honeſt Curate were inveſted with the Rectory, it would be well enough. That caſe therefore is to be conſidered, whether it be better generally ſpeaking for the Clergy now, than it would be if Pluralities were taken away. Now I think if matters be weighed impartially, we ſhall find it every way better, both for them and for the Church alſo, that Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are allowed. For by this means, a young man that cannot live in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity any longer, being bred up under the advice and direction of a learned Miniſter, and taking his directions and method, is much advanced in his hopes of being an eminent Schollar, and the expectation that he may thereupon be taken notice of by the Biſhop, or ſome neighbouring Gentleman, and ſo preferred to conſiderable places, will be ſtrange motives to improve in his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to demean himſelf ſo as to gain a good eſteem for his Piety and Learning. Farther, it will be a means to invite men of the fineſt Parts, and greateſt Abilities into the Service of the Church, when they ſee there is ſuch encouragements to be had.</p>
                     <p>But ſome will anſwer, there are Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks and other Dignities beſides, to invite eminent men, and to ſtir up others. There
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152722:90"/>are ſo, I acknowledge, to the great honour of our Nation, (and I wiſh an envious and a covetous Generation do not rob us of them) and they have that good effect, as to encourage and bring many learned men into the Church, but theſe Dignities are but a few in compariſon of the number of the Clergy, which ought to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and do very well deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by the Church. And though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps all are not provided for according to their merit, yet the encouragement that all may hope for in their time, by means of the allowance of Pluralities, does raiſe the expectations and ſtir up the induſtry of many that think themſelves utterly void of all likelyhood of any other advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>So that when the neceſſities of the Church will be better provided for, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple having two able men to look after them, inſtead of one only; and when the advancement of learning is like to be more promoted, the Wealthier part of the Clergy being enabled to ſtore themſelves with Books, and the inferior encouraged to hope they may one day by their Learning and Piety, arrive to the like Dignity, it muſt needs be for the great benefit of the Church to continue Pluralities.</p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:152722:90"/>
                     <p>Beſides, by this means a learned City Miniſter that has but a ſmall Revenue there, may have the aſſiſtance of a better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from a Country Living, to which he may ſometimes reſort for his own and the Peoples benefit, and not be tempted to bend to the Peoples humours to get a livelyhood. Matters may be ſo ordered, that a ſmall Vicaridge of a Factious Market Town, may be ſupplyed with a learned and able Miniſter, by the aſſiſtance of a neighbouring Benefice, that has but a ſmall Flock, and a large Revenue.</p>
                     <p>But ſome will ſay, men often put in piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ignorant and weak Curates. And would not he be as weak and ignorant altogether, if he were Rector or Vicar? And are there not Rectors and Vicars ſometimes that are weak and ignorant? Nay, if that be all the complaint, the caſe is better for the Pluraliſt. For if there be a weak Curate, that may be made up ſomewhat by an able Rector, or the Curate may be removed, and a better eaſily put in his place, or elſe he will have all the motives in the World to amend and improve himſelf, leſt he be put out. But if the Rector or Vicar be weak and ignorant, there is not ſo eaſie a help for it if he be tolerably competent, and when he knows he is in for his life, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152722:91"/>can hope for no other preferment, he will never take care to improve himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Our Author does farther move the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to take Cognizance of Pluraliſts, for the preventing an <hi>idle, ſcandalous, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſly-overgrown, unprofitable Miniſtry,</hi> p. 33. But how does Pluralities make men ſo? in the nature of the thing it is otherwiſe, the more work men have to do, and the greater encouragement they find, the more diligent and induſtrious they will prove. But I ſuppoſe he meant ſome Pluraliſts are ſo. But may not ſome alſo be thus to blame that are not Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts? An idle and covetous man will be ſo, if he has but one Living, and a diligent and conſcientious man will faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his duty if he has two. But to argue, The more men have, the worſe they will be, is a good Argument for Levellers, and may be as well uſed to prove all the Nobility and Gentry ought to part with moſt of their Eſtates, and become Farmers. Riches and Honours are Bleſſings from God, and may be means of doing good; if men abuſe them to ill purpoſes, that is their fault, but ought not to be uſed as Arguments, why other men ſhould be deprived of their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, but in an orderly way. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Pluraliſts are thus to blame, let
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152722:91"/>them be ſuſpended, and if they do not amend, let them be deprived of both their Benefices, but let not ſober and diligent men want due encouragement, becauſe ſome others are to blame, and make ill uſe of the Churches favours to them.</p>
                     <p>I plead not in behalf of any covetous or uſeleſs Drones, but for the encouragement and better maintenance of many diligent and learned men, which cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſo honourably for, as the Churches Patrimony will allow, but by the permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pluralities. And I ſuppoſe theſe Pluraliſts are or ſhould be imploying their time in other places for the benefit and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church. Neither would I have or think it reaſonable, that any Pluraliſt ſhould leave his Cure without a ſufficient and able Miniſter alwayes reſiding upon, or ſo near his Cure, as to be ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all occaſions of his Flock; nor is it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the Curate ſhould be without a comfortable maintenance according as the place will bear. And when the Churches Patrimony is wholly beſtowed upon men that labour in her Service, and every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh is provided of a Miniſter approved of by the Biſhop, what ground can there be for any juſt complaint, or accounting Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities to be ſuch grievances? Is there any thing in Scripture or right reaſon, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:152722:92"/>makes it neceſſary, that one that Preaches to Thirty people in a Country Village, ſhould have two or three hundred a year, and another that Preaches to two or three thouſand ſhould have but 30 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> becauſe the Revenues of the Pariſhes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be ſo widely unproportionable?</p>
                     <p>And there is as little reaſon that a lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man ſhould be tyed up to this hard choice, when he may have the overſight, and look after both, either to have a great maintenance and a little Flock, or a great Flock and a little maintenance.</p>
                     <p>God Almighty therefore, as he has left the care and Government of his Church, to the Biſhops and Paſtors thereof, ſo he has committed her Patrimony and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to their diſtribution, and I hope the ſecular Powers will leave thoſe matters in the hands of them with whom they are intruſted by God. If then they take care that every place be provided of an able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, where the maintenance will allow it, and every Miniſter have a comfortable allowance, God and men will commend their wiſdom, if they allot ſome qualified Perſons to have the charge of more Pariſhes than one, and alſo a more plentiful main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for their encouragement, and the very hopes of this will ſtir up all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to be diligent and faithful in their places,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152722:92"/>but where there is no farther hopes, many good men are apt to be remiſs in improving their Studies. So that it is an eaſie matter for People that little mind how they ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Brethren, to throw abroad wild aſperſions, and to heap up the words of <hi>idle, ſcandalous, covetouſly-overgrown, and unprofitable,</hi> with many more ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and then affix all upon Pluraliſts, and ſay Pluralities are the cauſe of all. But I doubt, if they would rightly conſider, they might find as great faults amongſt thoſe that have but ſingle Benefices, as amongſt Pluraliſts. And time was, when it has been truly replied to a Miniſter that preached againſt Pluralities and Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that his neighbours Pariſh was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupplied in the Rector's abſence, than his was, while he was reſident upon it. But all the poſſible evils true or falſe, muſt be thrown upon Pluraliſts as ſuch, becauſe they are the men that have leiſure and abilities to counterwork and lay open all their Factious and Schiſmatical deſigns, and have learnedly refuted all their Murmurs and Cavils againſt the Government, and are able to bear up their heads againſt all the contempt and ſcorn that ſome envious and turbulent men would caſt upon them. They are men that malign Religion it ſelf, or elſe the peace and proſperity of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152722:93"/>Church of <hi>England,</hi> or here and there are Politick, to curry favour with the people that thus decry Pluralities; for they find by experience her cauſe is ſo good, that while the Clergy have Learning and Wealth to maintain the juſtneſs thereof againſt all Faction and Oppoſition, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure keep up the Authority of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and their own Honour and Dignity, 'tis in vain for them to hope to overthrow it, but they know, if they can make the Clergy poor and ignorant, then they will be able to trample upon them as they pleaſe, make them bend and ſtoop to any baſe and mean complyance, and ſo inſtead of Governing their Flocks, they will be made Slaves to their humours, and wholly governed by them, ſo that 'tis not the care of the Flock, but envy at the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Learning of the Shepheards that makes men write and declaim againſt Pluralities.</p>

                     <p>BUT all this while (ſome will ſay) here is no thought of Charity or Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the two thouſand ſilenced Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, yet there is more Charity ſhewed to them than they ſhew to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as much Tenderneſs as to any man who was formerly ruined and undone by them for his Loyalty, and keeping a good Conſcience. Where are any of them puniſhed or called to an account for their former actings and miſcarriages? Have not both Church and State forgiven them, and left them in the ſame condition with other Chriſtians and Divines? Is there any other meaſure uſed to them than to the conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Clergy? and have not many that were great drivers that way, enjoyed as much of the Churches favours as the beſt in the Nation? Or was any turned out for any thing that he had done formerly, and was now willing to amend? That they know,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152722:94"/>they muſt not, nor cannot ſay. So that they can blame no body but themſelves, or the ill advice of their own Party, for they turned out themſelves, ſilenced themſelves, and then complain of the Churches hard uſage.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed, they muſt ſay, we might have kept in, if we would have ſubſcribed. But there is the hard dealing we complain of, that we were obliged to ſuch Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Declarations. But do not all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches obſerve the like method? And are there not harmonies of Confeſſions and Oaths of Canonical Obedience, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed generally in all places, to keep Clergy men to one uniform Agreement and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Duty? That they muſt acknowledge alſo to be uſual, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of the whole Chriſtian Church. But the matter of theſe Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions and Declarations is the thing the complain of. But to that I have ſpoke already, and ſhall only add, there is and ther inſtance of the Charity of the Church of <hi>England</hi> towards them, which is greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> than they have for themſelves, for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions required, are only to ſuch thing as 'tis ſitting they ſhould profeſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; and the Declarations are again thoſe Opinions and Practices, which for merly led them and many others into great
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152722:94"/>Schiſm and Rebellion. Now, can there be any eaſier ſatisfaction required of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, than only to renounce their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer errors, and promiſe to amend, and this without any manner of reflection or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and any others? The Church is rather too mild and eaſie, than too rigorous in this matter. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline pline of the ancient Church in ſuch caſes, was to make ſuch men come and make a ſolemn and publick Renunciation of their error, and profeſs an open Repentance for what they had done. But all this is paſt over in ſilence, and they are left to make their peace with God and their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and only to make ſuch Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Subſcriptions as may aſſure the Church they will avoid the like miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages for the time to come. But rather than do that, they will ſilence themſelves, and run into open Schiſm and Separation, and while they keep ſuch reſerves to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 'tis better to let an Enemy appear ſo, than to let him in, ſecretly to work his ends under the colour of being an outward Friend, and a falſe-hearted Brother. So that we muſt ſtill ſay, they can blame no body but themſelves that they are ſilenced, they muſt anſwer it to God that they have thrown themſelves out of the Service of the Church, by their own humours or miſtakes,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152722:95"/>for the Subſcriptions and Declarations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhew'd to be againſt any Word of God or any Doctrine of the Catholick Church in any Age, and are owned to be lawful by ten thouſand Clergy-men in this Nation, againſt which they oppoſe the judgment of two thouſand that ſilenced themſelves Eighteen years ago, never conſidering how many of theſe have upon better thoughts approved of theſe conditions, and thoſe of the greateſt eminence, as Dr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> formerly Divinity Profeſſor in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Dillingham</hi> once Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and how many others have been ſince dead, ſo that perhaps, there are not ſcarce five hundred of thoſe ſtill living, and muſt our Church be torn in pieces becauſe five hundred will not comply with it, when we have ten thouſand that have declared theſe things may lawfully and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably be done?</p>

Which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> uſhers in with this Preface,<note place="margin">Apol. P. 166. n. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>But the fulleſt deciſion of this caſe,</hi> [Of their Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] <hi>will be from their cauſe it ſelf.</hi> So that here we may expect their chiefeſt ſtrength. <hi>The Liturgy and Canon,</hi> 1. <hi>obligeth us to refuſe no Child that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us in Baptiſm.</hi> If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will allow that equity which is ſuppoſed to be meant, and alwayes intended by ſober men in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious actions, here can be no ground of any Objection. Take it therefore but thus,<note place="margin">See Rubr. before Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, the Parent ſhall give knowledge thereof.</note> as it ought to be underſtood. No Child offered by his Parent, or other Surety that has power to educate it in the profeſſion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:152722:96"/>that is to be made at Baptiſm, ought to be refuſed. For Chriſt's Commiſſion is, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all Nations,</hi> and therefore all Children have a right to it, if there will any body ſeriouſly offer them, who have power to educate them in that profeſſion. And the Parent is to offer it, that is, the Father, Mother, or other that is <hi>in loco Parentis.</hi>

To ſay the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs or the ſin of the God-father or Father, can deprive the baptized Child of the benefit of God's Ordinance, is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous opinion, without any ground or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:152722:96"/>colour, and contrary to the word of God, which tells us under the new Covenant, God will not take up that Proverb, <hi>The Fathers have eaten ſower Grapes,</hi>

And the wickedneſs of the wicked upon him.</hi> 2. 'Tis contrary to the nature of a Sacrament, which is God's Ordinance, and confers Grace where the receiver puts no bar, as Infants cannot, and not where by-ſtanders, or others neglect their duty. When was it ever aſſerted in any ſetled Church, that the actual Sanctification of the Sponſor, was neceſſary to the Child's Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:152722:97"/>diſcretion, that there can be no poſſible ground of complaint.</p>
                     <p>Object. 5. <hi>When they are Sick, if they will ſay they repent and deſire it, they muſt be abſolved in abſolute terms, though they give the Miniſter no ſatisfaction that they are truly penitent, and have lived,</hi> &amp;c. This is not fairly conſtrued, but ſtretching words beyond all reaſon. If the words had been only, <hi>if he repent, or ſay he repent,</hi> it muſt be ſuppoſed ſeriouſly and gravely, as to outward appearance. But the Churches condition of Abſolution is, <hi>if he humbly and heartily deſire it.</hi> And then,<note place="margin">Rubrick before Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</note> though Abſolution be in abſolute terms, yet 'tis alwayes underſtood to avail only, <hi>Clave non errante,</hi> and the Penitent is ſuppoſed to underſtand it will do him no good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his Confeſſion and Repentance be full and ſincere. Let perſons obſerve therefore whether Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has dealt fairly in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, to leave out ſuch full words, as <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and heartily deſire it,</hi> to make it ſeem odious.</p>
                     <p>Object. 6. <hi>Being dead, we muſt pronounce our hope except,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>that God in mercy hath taken to himſelf the ſoul of this our dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the miſeries of this World, though they were Atheiſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and never ſo much as ſaid, I repent.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does confeſs in other places, ſuppoſing the Orders of the Church
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152722:98"/>were obſerved, theſe words might well enough be uſed. If therefore all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters would come in and help forward Diſcipline, this Aſperſion would be taken away. Therefore they will cauſe Diviſions and ſpoil Diſcipline, and breed Atheiſm, and then urge Objections which they have been the cauſe of. But let us conſider the words as they lye in the Churches Office, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has ill jumbled together. As to the words <hi>Dear Brother,</hi> all Chriſtians are our Brethren, and their Souls ought to be Dear to us, though ſome more than others. 2. 'Tis <hi>in great mercy that God has taken to himſelf</hi> any wicked man, to judge him equitably himſelf, and not leaving him to the Devils pleaſure. And Secondly, preventing him from increaſing his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by longer continuance in ſin. But then ſome will ſay the hardeſt words are yet to come. <hi>As our hope is, this our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth.</hi> This may be conſidered in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as they are ſubſcribed to, and then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the order obſerved, which the Church has preſcribed, within our Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption we alwayes ſuppoſe, there can be no doubt, but in the judgment of Charity we ought to ſay, <hi>As our hope is, this our Brother doth.</hi> But then as to matter of Fact, if a caſe does happen otherwiſe, may not the Miniſter deſire a neighbour that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152722:98"/>is a ſtranger to the caſe, to bury ſuch a perſon, without giving any reaſon, and he knowing nothing to the contrary, may charitably pronounce, <hi>As our hope is this our Brother doth,</hi> which is as faint an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion as a man can uſe, or elſe in that caſe he may refuſe to bury him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Biſhop with his reaſon, who no doubt will eaſily excuſe him, if the caſe be evident and notorious. For the reaſon of the Law is, to prevent all peeviſh, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous, and careleſs neglect.</p>
                     <p>Object. 7. <hi>And the Diſcipline of the Church being managed by one Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and his Court, with ſmall aſſiſtance in a Dioceſs of many hundred Pariſhes, is utterly uncapable of calling one of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to Repentance, or keeping clean the Church.</hi> If all the whole burden lay upon ſome few perſons, there were a great deal of weight in this Objection, but there are belonging generally to the Cognizance of ſuch cauſes, Arch-deacons, Commiſſaries, Officials, ſeveral Surrogates, and the Miniſters of every Pariſh, whoſe Principal work is, to inſtruct, reprove and excite men to Repentance, and if they neglect to hear them, they can ſuſpend them from the Communion, which is no ſmall part of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and then complain of them to the Court, (or mind the Church-warden to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152722:99"/>do his duty,) where they may be publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excommunicated, and if there were as many more preſented as there are, the Court could eaſily hear and give right judgment concerning them. But if upon publick Examination, the crime be not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally proved againſt ſuch a Perſon, or he does hypocritically ſubmit, without any real amendment, the Miniſter may admit him to the Communion notwithſtanding, as our Saviour did <hi>Judas,</hi> without any ſcandal or blame, for no external judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can provide againſt Hypocriſie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt any body be condemned and ſhut out of the Church and from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges thereof, without proof of his crimes, ſo that if there be Information and Witneſſes, the Judges of the Biſhops Courts can eaſily decide all Controverſies of this kind, as well as the Twelve Judges do all the Civil and Criminal Miſdemeanours of the Kingdom, that come to any open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt before them. And how Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhould make an Objection here I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſince here is much better care taken than in his Model, for a Miniſter may do as much by our preſent Conſtitution, as he ſuppoſeth his Parochial Biſhop to do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he will take off the liberty of an appeal, which the Law of nature, and the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all Churches allow. And is not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152722:99"/>the Miniſter like to deal better with a ſtubborn Offender when he has the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Biſhop, the Court, the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>wn private Conviction with a few of his neighbours? and may not the Miniſter and Congregation too be very faulty? And then in his Parochial Epiſcopacy, I do not ſee any remedy; but in our way both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, People and Biſhop alſo have Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors to look after them, and ſee to the keeping up of good order, and exerciſing Diſcipline in the Church. And then as if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had given ſuch invincible reaſons, the ſayes, <hi>Theſe are much of that which Non-conformiſts refuſe to ſubſcribe their full Aſſent and Conſent to, and to Covenant never to endeavour to reform, for which they ſuffer the loſs of all.</hi> But how falſly the Churches Rules are miſrepreſented, her equitable meanings perverted, and upon the whole matter, how frivolous the Objections are, I leave all unprejudiced perſons to judge. As for what is added concerning Perjury, God forbid that any ſhould mean that, much leſs deſire any one to do it, but if they think that is the caſe in Conformity, we pitty their weakneſs, and commend their honeſty in avoiding it, and if a bare pretence, and ſaying ſo were enough, a

                     <p>But if the Offender, when he comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop, does promiſe to ſubmit and take an Oath to obey the commands of the Church, then Penance is injoyned, and he is Admoniſhed to certifie his order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behaviour to the Biſhop, and what far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152722:103"/>can be expected, or who can require any more? Neither is this only in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but actually practiſed almoſt every day, and multitudes are by this means kept from many ſcandalous offences, and others are brought to Repentance and a Holy Converſation, and were it not that Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters provide ſhelters for them, and ſo upon the leaſt threatning or diſtaſt, they did flock to them, and laugh at all publick cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, viſible purity might be generally kept up, and the World would ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the Epiſcopal Government, is not only the moſt ancient, but the moſt effectual to preſerve Unity and Holineſs in the Church.</p>
                     <p>But it will be objected, the Biſhop does not know the temper of the man, the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Witneſſes; becauſe he lives at ſuch a diſtance, and has ſo many under his Charge; and therefore how can he judge what is fit to be done? the perſonal care is committed to the Miniſters of each Pariſh, in all ordinary caſes, and they are here and there ſome difficult caſes only, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous open offences which come to the Biſhop, which need no other knowledge of the perſon, than the clear proof of credible Witneſſes, that he is guilty of them, and thereupon the Biſhop is to proceed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn him Repentance, which if he refuſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152722:103"/>to Excommunicate him as I ſaid before. Many thouſands of theſe caſes may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard and decided if the perſons appear, in a very ſhort time by the Biſhop and his aſſiſtants that act in his name; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ordinary number of people in a Dioceſs, may be ſufficiently governed and inſpected by the Biſhop, ſo as to keep a viſible profeſſion of purity in Religion, for there needs no long conference, the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is only, Guilty, or not Guilty? Do you Repent or do you not Repent? Which are quickly decided.</p>
                     <p>But is that enough only to ſay it, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? He is not only to ſay I repent, but to make ſolemn profeſſion thereof, either in the Church, or before ſome publick perſons, and this is all that any external judicature can require. And unleſs there be extraordinary ſigns of thorough-Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, time is, and ought to be ſet for them to ſhew ſome fruits of Repentance, before they be admitted to the Communion; which the Miniſter and Church-wardens of each Pariſh are to certifie to the Biſhop. So that if the Biſhop alone were perſonally concerned to inſpect the whole Dioceſs, then it was impoſſible ever it could be done; but ſince there are ſo many Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under him to attend his charge in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pariſh, and only the weightier matters,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152722:104"/>or points of Controverſie, that cannot be ended in each Pariſh, that are brought to him or his aſſiſtants, he may very well keep all in good order, ſuppoſing the Miniſters do their duty, as well as the twelve Judges by the help of the Juſtices of Peace, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all the Temporal cauſes of the Kingdom without any failure of Juſtice on their part, except in time of publick Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>And if Diſcipline in the Church be now not executed as it ought to be, it is becauſe Diſſenters have made a Schiſm, which is an Eccleſiaſtical Rebellion in the Church, and people Mutiny and refuſe to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by their Biſhops. In ſuch caſes no general rules can be fixed, but the Biſhop and his Clergy muſt take the beſt courſe he can on all emergencies, and this is our caſe at this time by the diſturbance the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters give the Government both in Church and State; and when multitudes do thus Excommunicate themſelves, till matters are brought to a Settlement, or there be ſome proſpect of it, and open di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and ſetting up of Churches againſt Churches be taken away, 'tis not to be hoped that Diſcipline will have that effect it ought to have.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of Lay-Chancellors.</head>
                     <p>THE Church indeed does ſpeak much of the Biſhop who is a learned and pious Divine, but we ſee little of him, but are turned over, God help us, to a Lay-Chancellor, ſir <hi>Timothy</hi> I do not know who, and he muſt Lord it over us, and Excommunicate us as he pleaſes; this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs does need ſome Explanation. And firſt it is to be noted, that the Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor is no part of the Hierarchy, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by any Law of the Church, neither is there any Law to require that there ſhould be a Lay-Chancellor at all, only an Act of Parliament in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's dayes does empower Doctors of Civil Law, though not in Holy Orders, to ſit Judges in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Courts, if they be lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned ſo to do, and therefore they are no part of the Government, which our Declaration does forbid men to endeavour an alteration of, and to be no exception againſt it. Let us then enquire into the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152722:105"/>reaſon of their admiſſion; and firſt, the chiefeſt is for the upholding the ſtudy and profeſſion of the Civil and Canon Laws, which is very needful for the Government, and there is little encouragement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it any other way.</p>
                     <p>But muſt the Church be haraſſed and undone, to breed up men to ſerve the State? Cannot the Civil Government provide for it ſelf, without laying ſuch an unſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble load upon the Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Government were ſetled, and things brought into order again, I do not ſee, as the Laws ſtand, that there could be any ground of complaint in this matter, for there are many intricacies in the forms of Law, by the granting the Cognizance of Teſtaments and Adminiſtrations, Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial cauſes, and Suites about Alimony and Divorce, petty Tithes, Dilapidations, Defamations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that require a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the Forms and Rules of Canon and Civil Law, and they are of too mean a nature, many times for the Biſhop to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his time about them; therefore as <hi>Moſes</hi> did appoint Judges and Officers to examine all leſſer cauſes, and the weightier were brought to him; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he had the care of all the Churches lying upon him, is not to be ſuppoſed perſonally to inſpect every little matter, but only to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152722:105"/>have a general eye to publick Peace and Order, and decide the greater matters which could not be ended without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing of his own Authority: So the Biſhop in reaſon, and by the conſtant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Church, is permitted to have his Officers under him, to take off a part of his burden in ordinary matters, and to diſpatch buſineſs when he is Sick or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe imployed, and then the caſes of Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Alimony, Dilapidations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> why may he not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point an expert Doctor of Civil Law to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them without any hurt to the Church?</p>
                     <p>But how can he Excommunicate? He does not, nor cannot excommunicate,<note place="margin">See Can. 1571. C. Cancel Commiſſ. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> for that is only an Eccleſiaſtical cenſure. But the Church in that caſe has Decreed, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of inſtance and <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> the Sentence of the Lay-Chancellor ſhould be Obligatory unleſs ſuſpended or retracted by an appeal, and thereupon does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all perſons contumacious and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate that do not ſubmit to it, and require the Miniſter upon a Certificate thereof, to denounce him as ſuch, declared and pronounced ſo by the Laws of the Church. And herein the Church did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our Saviour's direction, who does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, If a man will Sue thee at the Law, and take away thy Coat, let him
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152722:106"/>have thy Cloak alſo, much more then does require us to ſubmit to the Sentence of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Groat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither can he be a good Chriſtian, that will neither appeal to prove the Sentence unjuſt, nor ſatisfie the legal dues, which the judge has Decreed he ought to pay, and therefore in all caſes of inſtance the Church may very well declare thoſe Excommunicate that do not appeal, nor obey the Sentence of a Lay-Chancellor, without other hearing the matter over again, if the perſon be able to pay. So that no man is excommunicated only for a Groat, but for contumacy and injuſtice, which are damning ſins, when obſtinately perſiſted in againſt publick Admonition and command to make ſatisfaction, and he is able to do it.</p>
                     <p>But the Lay-Chancellor does alſo judge in Criminal cauſes, and matters purely Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual alſo, as Hereſie, Schiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is allowed in ſuch caſes, to examine into the forms of the Law, and ſee that the Proofs and all matters relating to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be duely obſerved, but he is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to excommunicate or pronounce the Sentence, that the Biſhop or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal judge himſelf muſt only do, or ſome other Grave Divine appointed by them, and ſo lawfully Authorized by Chriſt and his Church to excommunicate all obſtinate
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152722:106"/>and impenitent ſinners.<note place="margin">Conſtit. 5. 1597. c. de exceſſ. cir. excom.</note> 
                        <hi>It is provided as often as the cenſure of Excommunication is to be inflicted for the immediate puniſhment of any notorious Hereſie, Schiſm, Simony, Perjury, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, Inceſt, Adultery, or any other grievous crime, the Sentence ſhall be pronounced, either by the Arch-Biſhop, Biſhop, Dean, Arch-Deacon, or Prebendary (ſo that he be in Holy Orders, and endued with Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical juriſdiction) in his own perſon, together with ſuch Company and aſſiſtance as may conduce to give the greater Authority to the thing. And laſtly, that every Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general, Official or Commiſſary, that has not taken Holy Orders, ſhall call and aſſociate to himſelf ſome learned Prieſt, impowered with ſufficient Authority, either by the Biſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his juriſdiction, or the Arch-Deacon (being a Prieſt) in his juriſdiction, and he ſhall pronounce the Sentence of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for Contumacy, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Judge then preſent.</hi> So that in all caſes of inſtance, the Law does ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man that does not proſecute an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal is juſtly condemned, and thereupon order the Miniſter upon Certificate of his refuſing to obey the Sentence of the Judge, though a Lay-man, and to denounce him as excommunicate, though in thoſe caſes alſo, uſually there is a Clergy-man to pronounce the Sentence. But in all Criminal matters,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:152722:107"/>the caſe is to be particularly conſidered by the Biſhop or Eccleſiaſtical Judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or a Prieſt, appointed and delegated to that purpoſe by the Biſhop, and ſo by the Act of the Church; and conſequently he refuſes to hear the Church, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by her, that will not obey the Biſhop, or a Prieſt appointed by him to hear and determine ſuch matters. And does not this look much more like the Act of the Church, when it is done according to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Laws and Canons of the Church, in a formal way of Judicature, in a known cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, whither all may reſort, and by a man expert and long imployed in ſuch affairs, than to leave it to the Arbitrary diſcretion of every Pariſh-Prieſt, whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> have exalted to the order of an independent Biſhop? So that our Saviour's words, <hi>Tell it to the Church,</hi> may very well, notwithſtanding their Jeers and Reflections, be interpreted to belong to the Biſhop and his Court, and ſuch other Judicatories which the Church in all Ages has appointed, to examine and determine all matters of Controverſie and publick ſcandal, that did any wayes diſturb or pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute her Communion; neither can there any juſt exception be made againſt our preſent Conſtitutions in this kind. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Regulations might not be thought
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:152722:107"/>of, to prevent the abuſes that may happen from ſome ill men, I leave it to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Governours to conſider.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> The true point in difference between Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and my ſelf conſidered.</head>
                     <p>FROM the words but now ſet down, it does appear, that Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with me, is for juſtifying their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing, and maintaining that they ought not thereupon to preach in this Nation without publick Licenſe, or keep any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Meetings, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does think himſelf bound to do, <hi>under pain of God's diſpleaſure and of Damnation, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Prohibitions</hi> of his Superiors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and he does endeavour to prove it by ſeveral Arguments, but they do not at all come home to his purpoſe, for they only prove that Miniſters ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their calling in general, or neglect the exerciſe of their Office when they are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully authorized and required to do their duty, which I do as much own and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelf; but none of his Arguments do in the leaſt prove, that he ought to exerciſe his Office in <hi>England</hi> in this or that Pariſh, or where he pleaſes
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152722:111"/>himſelf. Where is there any Law of God to require him to exerciſe his Function here againſt the Laws and Conſtitutions Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and Civil of the Nation, where there are other lawful Miniſters duely ſetled in all places already, to exerciſe this Office? And what Order, Diſcipline or Concord could ever be kept up in the Church, if every body might take that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to call a Congregation together, where, and when, and as oft as he pleaſes, and be tyed to no Rules, but thoſe of his own making? For Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſayes, <hi>He is bound notwithſtanding any Prohibition,</hi> and ſo a <hi>Socinian</hi> will ſay, and a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> a <hi>Jew;</hi> and can it be ſuppoſed that God has left the Government of his Church to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties? 'Tis plain he has not, for the Scripture ſayes,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.32, 33.</note> 
                        <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> much more then, inferior Miniſters in the Church are ſubject to others. And then the Apoſtle gives a reaſon, <hi>For God is not the Author of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion but of Peace, as in all Churches of the Saints,</hi> plainly intimating, for Order and Peace ſake, in all the Churches, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Prophets muſt be ſubject to the other Prophets, and the Spirits of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to the reſt of the Paſtors, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there needs no External force to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:152722:111"/>ſtop their mouths, and moral ſilencing is ſufficient, and is all the Authority Chriſt gave the Officers of his Church, and that he has backt with power enough to make any man ſubmit,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>For if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen man and a Publican.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as the Scripture is plain againſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſo the Laws and cuſtoms of all Churches do condemn it for Schiſmatical, for a man to come into another Miniſter's charge, and there exerciſe his Office with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave and conſent, and againſt the publick Conſtitutions of each particular Church, wherein he thruſts himſelf. If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> could ſay, we were no true Church, and Salvation could not be had in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, then I confeſs notwithſtanding any Prohibition, he might be bound to preach the Goſpel amongſt us, and any man that is really perſwaded ſo of us, may think the like, but this Mr. <hi>B,</hi> and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> does not nor cannot pretend, and therefore 'tis againſt all reaſon and the rule of all Churches and Societies whatſoever, for them and other men to thruſt themſelves into another man's charge, not only without lawful allowance, but contrary to the expreſs Laws of that place where they come.</p>
                     <p>And the reaſon of this is plain in nature, becauſe 'tis impoſſible to keep men in any
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:152722:112"/>obedience to their Governours, and Peace and Concord amongſt themſelves where this liberty is admitted, for Jealouſies and Emulations will alwayes ariſe, and people are naturally apt to be mutinous and unquiet upon the leaſt ſuggeſtion, and will grow into compariſons between licenſed and Non-licenſed Preachers, and when an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licenſed man does find pitty and favour amongſt the ignorant multitude, fleſh and blood will tempt good men to inſinuate the ill management of affairs, and leſſen the reverence and eſteem they ſhould have for their lawful Superiors, and by degrees work them to be clamorous and greedy of changes, and what Piety and Love will be promoted by perſons, whoſe fancies are heated with new Models and Projects, and diſaffected againſt their lawful Governours? That time which ſhould be ſpent in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing their Luſts, Reading and Meditating God's Word, encouraging one another in Holineſs and the continual Service of God, will be employed in murmurs and making Parties, Plotting and contriving how to deſtroy this, and ſet up another Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this was evidently the buſineſs of the late ſwarms of Lecturers before the Wars, who did by that means prepare the peoples minds for thoſe changes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by their <hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz, ſtir them up to effect ſuch deſigns.</p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:152722:112"/>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is ſenſible 'tis againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that every pretender ſhould be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Preach. Therefore, he ſayes,<note place="margin">Plea for Peace. P. 99.</note> 4. <hi>If a Heretick or intolerable perſon muſt ſet up a Preacher, or if any turn Heretick, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Churches are (after due admonition) to renounce him as unacceptible of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that he may be ſhamed and avoided.</hi> 5. <hi>If yet he continue obſtinate, and do more harm than good, the Magiſtrate is Ruler, and muſt reſtrain him, and deny him leave ſo to Preach in his Dominions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what is this to Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Preaching, who does a great deal of good by it? To which I anſwer, that which I ſaid before will unavoidably follow, it will be a means to breed Jealouſies, Murmurings, ſecret undervaluing of their proper Governours, and conſequently Schiſm, Faction and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and therefore all preaching againſt the allowance of Authority in true Churches where all things neceſſary to Salvation are to be had, was ever condemned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Schiſmatical by all Churches and moſt ſober Divines, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> cannot but well know.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Apol. p. 19</note> 
                        <hi>He does preach but as a poor aſſiſtant to thoſe faithful Miniſters that have publick allowance.</hi> What Mr. <hi>B.</hi> intends has not that good effect, for 'tis not an aſſiſtance but an hinderance, for the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:152722:113"/>people are by that means kept from fixing themſelves ſtedfaſtly to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> reverencing thoſe faithful Miniſters which are allowed, as is notorious in all experience. And though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> owns himſelf as a poor aſſiſtant, others who preach by the encouragement of his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, do formally boaſt themſelves for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and properer Paſtors, and plainly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and revile the Church, and draw Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties after them from her Communion. If it be left to every Preacher's diſcretion that will ſet up himſelf, under pretence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more good than harm, and being a poor aſſiſtant to carry on the main work of the Goſpel, as they all ſay they do, it will be impoſſible ever to prevent ſuch Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Confuſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But if they preach any Faction or Sedition, or any thing in derogation of the Government, or allowed Miniſters, then ſilence and puniſh them, but if they think it convenienteſt ſo to do, they will cry out againſt Perſecution, as much as if they were not allowed at all. But far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ſhall inform the Governours of their miſcarriages? Their own Party will not, and every ordinary man is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcern their miſchievous Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Governours may appoint ſome. So that there muſt be a new charge brought
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:152722:113"/>upon the Nation, to maintain ſo many Miniſters as Spyes over the unlicenſed Preachers, and the Government will be perpetually diſturbed with hearing and puniſhing ſuch offences, and the peoples minds alwayes diſtracted with Contentions and Oppoſitions. Therefore right reaſon as well as the conſtant order of all Churches do direct, that where there is a publick Service, which 'tis lawful for Chriſtians to joyn in, as not only Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but the main body of Non-conforming Miniſters do confeſs, ours is, and where Salvation may be had in the Communion which is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no men ought to ſet up ſeparate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, nor upon any pretence, preach without Licenſe ſo to do, under the Guilt of Schiſm, and diſturbing the Peace of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> being well aware of this, ſayes, they are not to preach, but when they ſhall do <hi>more good than harm.</hi> But who ſhall judge of that? For ſuppoſe we allow Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to judge for himſelf in things that concern his Perſonal duty and behaviour, yet in things that belong to the publick, and have influence upon the Peace of the Church and State, as all publick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and calling a Congregation together has, that in a true and ſetled Church, muſt not be done by private men alone, againſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:152722:114"/>the will of the Governours, for 'tis not their place to judge of publick matters, beſides, no man ought ſolely to be judge in his own caſe, whether he does more good than harm, for men are apt to be too partial and favourable to themſelves, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a private man in a capacity to judge truly when his labours do more good than harm; for though the work he does, in it ſelf be good, and the intention truly Pious, yet the example may be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and the conſequence fatal to the publick Peace, and that a private man may ſee at leaſt and repent of, when the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs cannot be prevented. Therefore let every man keep within his own bounds, private men to private duties, and leave the publick to thoſe who are publickly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, and that is keeping in God's way, and is a far more likely means to do good, than for private men to ſet up themſelves againſt publick order and command.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has one farther anſwer ſtill, that he does only preach where there is <hi>real and notorious need.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apol. p. 19.</note> Now that he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes does happen in two caſes. Where the Miniſter is ſo ſcandalouſly weak, that he is not able to inſtruct the people in things neceſſary to Salvation, or elſe the Pariſh ſo vaſtly big, that the people cannot joyn with their Miniſter. Theſe do at firſt ſeem
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:152722:114"/>colourable pretences, but will appear little to his purpoſe, and altogether groundleſs to authorize his Preaching.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That is not the caſe of the hundredth part of the diſſenting Preachers, ſo that they are all condemned for Schiſmaticks, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this laſt refuge in their defence. Come we to conſider the other mens caſes. And firſt, where the Miniſter is ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly weak, but who has judged him ſo, have they modeſtly repreſented the caſe to the Biſhop, and have they his judgment that he is ſcandalouſly weak? If ſo, the Biſhop may, and will remove him for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, or ſend him a Co-adjutor, this is frequent and common. No, that they muſt confeſs they have not, nor ever went about it, but they judge ſo. What a hard caſe then the poor Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are in, if they had not more merciful Judges. To be judged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed, for that is all one to be depoſed from the hearts and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their Flocks, wherein is their greateſt comfort, becauſe a private Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer ſhall inveigle and tell the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he is inſufficient, and he will teach them and inſtruct them better, and be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as heard, or have his caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered but by his accuſers.</p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:152722:115"/>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe the Miniſter of the Pariſh to be really none of the greateſt Clerks, does he not officiate in his place duely and gravely, and Adminiſter the Sacraments according to publick order? So that here the publick Service of God is ſufficiently provided for by the Church, and that they cannot fail in, and perhaps he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it more gracefully than a much abler man. And then in the very Churches Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, there is the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, and the Catechiſm, wherein are contained the ſubſtance of every man's duty, beſides Homilies appointed by the Church, and if any one deſires farther Information, there are multitudes of excellent Sermons which he may read at home, and many other good Books, or he may remove to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pariſh, or in caſe of any difficulty or ſcruple, he may go to the Biſhop or ſome other conformable Divine for his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how then can there poſſibly be ſuch <hi>real and notorious need</hi> for the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts to Preach. And the like anſwer may very well be given concerning the great Pariſhes where the Churches will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Inhabitants, they may in that caſe go to other Churches or Chappels, till care be taken to erect more Churches, which ought to be done.</p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:152722:115"/>
                     <p>I would put it to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether he thinks there is a man in the Kingdom, that, generally ſpeaking, might not find room in one Pariſh Church or Chappel or another, almoſt every Lord's day, if he did but uſe the ordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which he does about his other affairs, at leaſt ſo as to joyn in the publick Prayers and Sacraments, which are the principal duties of ſolemn Aſſemblies, to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Preaching the Word and Catechizing are very well joyned, and it were deſirable that all Pariſhes were ſo ordered, that all the Inhabitants could conveniently hear in their own Church; but though that be not done as yet, they may go to others where they have better convenience, and adviſe with able Miniſters in difficult matters in the mean time, and uſe their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to have more Churches erected. I am confident there is not a man in the Nation that can ſay, but that he might have had opportunity of joyning in publick Prayers and Sacraments, and be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in all parts of his duty, (if he did deſire it) by the Conformiſts of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and it muſt be every man's own willful neglect, if he want convenient means of leading a Chriſtian life, and in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and then where is this <hi>real and notorious
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:152722:116"/>need</hi> for Non-conformiſts Preaching? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> if he would ſeriouſly conſider it, cannot but know that the cauſe of the great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Debaucheries that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, proceeds from the contempt of Eccleſiaſtical Authority, which his Writings have as much contributed to as moſt mens, for by this means the lazy and careleſs will not come to learn and be inſtructed, and the profane will not be brought to practiſe what they know, and while there is this crowd of Sects, and ſuch hot diſputes againſt Epiſcopacy, and the force of the Churches Excommunication, 'tis impoſſible that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline ſhould have any effect towards out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reformation, for multitudes can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bluſh or be aſhamed, neither will Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication be dreaded while men can run over to another Society, and be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by them, and have perſons about in every corner, to tell them the Churches Excommunication ſignifies nothing.</p>
                     <p>Did the Diſſenters make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to aſſert the Churches Authority, and tell all their Followers that a man excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by his own Biſhop, for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the publick Service, and joyning in Prayers and Sacraments, or for any evident breach of the known Goſpel-duties, was cut off from the body of Chriſt, and the Communion of the faithful all over the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152722:116"/>World, and that it was Schiſm for any Church to receive him into any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for Chriſtian Worſhip, till he did declare his repentance and ſubmiſſion to his own Biſhop, as the Canons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> did declare, and the univerſal Church ever taught, and thereupon avoid them as Heathens and Publicans, then there were ſome hopes of Reformation, and that Diſcipline would take effect, for 'tis not for want of knowledge that Drunkards, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and moſt profane perſons periſh, but out of unrulineſs of Spirit, becauſe they will not practiſe what they know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe matters, and ſo the ignorant and lazy do know they are in a wrong way, but ſince they find no Temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience by it, they are contented to pleaſe their preſent humour, and never think what will follow upon it, therefore if Diſſenters were really in earneſt for Peace and Holineſs, inſtead of declaring againſt Dioceſans, crying out upon Perſecution, they would joyn to encourage Diſcipline, and aſſiſt the Biſhops and Governours of this Church in reſtoring that reverence and Authority which is due to their lawful cenſures. But inſtead of that, hideous out-cries are made, the Kingdoms undone, Souls periſh, and multitudes are damned, becauſe 1800 ſilenced themſelves eighteen
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:152722:117"/>years ago, and would not ſubmit to thoſe rules which were neceſſary to the publick ſafety, and promiſe to uphold that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which they lived, though there have thrice eighteen hundred grown up ſince, as able, and it may be much abler men than they, and yet ſtill the clamour is freſh of eighteen hundred Non-conformiſt Preachers, without which Religion muſt ſink, and the Church be deſtroyed, and without any conſideration how many of theſe have conformed ſince, and theſe of great eminence, Dr. <hi>Conant</hi> Titular <hi>Regius</hi> Profeſſor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Dr. <hi>Dillingham</hi> Maſter of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge, and Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fog, &amp;c.</hi> and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of them are dead, yet eighteen hundred muſt keep up the noiſe, and to make up a round ſumm, ſometimes it muſt be enhanced to two thouſand. If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had ſeen thereupon our Pulpits empty, our Church doors ſhut up for want of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the people groaning for want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſerve God and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, then there had been ſome ground of complaint, but neither can we ſee nor hear any want of theſe in any publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt ſuppoſe there was ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible excellency in theſe eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that was the life and ſoul of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:152722:117"/>in this Nation, though no body knows why, or upon what account. And the eight thouſand others that continued ſtill in the Church, muſt go for nothing, nor the conformable Clergy that returned to their Charges from whence they had been driven by the Rebels, but all's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, unleſs the Hedges be broken down, and Non-conformiſts brought into the Church with Triumph, to let in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of Forty one, and fall heartily to work to deſtroy the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for elſe they are no otherwiſe ſilenced than other men are, and they would be ſilenced in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> or any other Chriſtian Church, if they would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to live peaceably and not go about to overturn the Government, and this is all that is required of them, and they rather chooſe to ſilence themſelves, than to tye up their hands from endeavouring Changes and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in that Government, that Order, and thoſe Circumſtances and Rites the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church ever had, and moſt ſetled Churches practiſe or approve of, and how juſt and equitable they are in themſelves, the foregoing diſcourſe I hope will ſatisfie all reaſonable and unprejudiced men, and conſequently Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his Brethren muſt bear the blame for ſilencing themſelves, but upon the whole matter, have no reaſon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:152722:118"/>to complain of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who has been too favourable in admitting them without publick Pennance, rather than any way rigorous in laying hard Impoſitions.</p>

For they will find it was my chief deſign to prevent theſe miſchieſs, and to perſwade all ſober perſons to renounce theſe Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Principles of Paplſts and Diſſenters, and ſeriouſly to endeavour after the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Peace and Settlement by uniting to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed

This Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does not nor cannot refute in one particular, but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point ſayes the ſame thing all along that I do, as I have ſhewed in this diſcourſe, but only when my Arguments, and his own downright Poſitions, came to be applyed to his own caſe, then he ſtarts at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and ſayes, the caſe is altered, as the great Lawyer did, and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> muſt be a lawleſs man, tyed to no Rules, bound to no Orders, but rove and range, cenſure and condemn, and if any one talks of reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, he muſt be one of <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Puny Counſellers.</p>
                     <p>But pray Mr. <hi>B.</hi> be not ſo Partial, let Concluſions hold that have good Premiſes, and let Particulars be included in Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and allow but the Church of God to have as much prudence as you and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and then we ſhall hear no more the noiſe of Canoneers, nor complaints of Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about a few innocent circumſtances of Government and Worſhip, and <hi>England</hi> will become ſetled in Peace and true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

                        <hi>and they are not capable to be any otherwiſe ſtated.</hi> And yet he ſayes, <hi>The ground and reaſon of our refraining Communion from Parochial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, is,</hi>

                        <hi>the Practice and Impoſition of things not lawful for us to obſerve in them.</hi> And then afterwards he tells us in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner what would take off his ſcruples.<note place="margin">Pag. 360.</note> 
                        <hi>If before the end of the ſecond Century, any proof or undoubted Teſtimony can be produced, of the Impoſition of the neceſſary uſe of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, or of ſtated Ceremonies of practice of Church-Diſcipline, conſiſtent with that now in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>it will go a great way in the determination of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between us.</hi> Now all theſe being circumſtances of Worſhip no way deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in Scripture, but left to Chriſtian prudence directed by the light of nature, and the general rules of Scripture, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> ſayes, I can ſee no reaſon that Dr. <hi>O.</hi> can poſſibly give, that they ſhould become unlawful by being impoſed by the Church, or why he ſhould require a proof of their Impoſition before the end of the ſecond Century, as a condition of his agreement with us about them.</p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:152722:119"/>
                     <p>If they were matters, of Doctrine, or Sacramental Rites with power to confer grace, he would do well to require ſome probable Argument of their obſervance in the ſecond Century, nay farther, ſome Inſtitution or Foundation in Scripture, but for circumſtances of Worſhip, which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Chriſtian prudence may apply, ſurely the undoubted uſage of thirteen hundred years, or the Inſtitution of a particular Church are warrant enough. And yet I doubt not if Dr. <hi>O.</hi> would conſider theſe matters with a little candor, he would ſee very probable if not demonſtrative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that theſe Circumſtances he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, were in uſe before the end of the ſecond Century. For the ſign of the Croſs, do not <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> plainly tell us, it was generally uſed in their time, and give not the leaſt ſuſpition that it was then firſt impoſed, but plainly imply, it deſcended down from ancient Tradition. Does not St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> the like for the Surplice, and then about Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at our receiving the Sacrament, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſayes, Mr. <hi>Paybody</hi> has fully ſatisfied him, and it being a geſture in Prayer uſed by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, I need alledge no other proof for the lawfulneſs of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it being a geſture naturally ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the greateſt reverence, I cannot
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:152722:120"/>ſee but that if ever it be to be uſed, it ought to be at Prayers and receiving the Sacrament, where we ought to appear with the higheſt Devotion, and therefore very probably ſuppoſe it was obſerved by thoſe holy Chriſtians before the end of the ſecond Century.</p>
                     <p>Then for the uſe of Liturgies, Dr. <hi>O.</hi> cannot but know that from the times of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> they have been conſtantly in uſe, and that there are Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies that go under the names of St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> which learned men do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppoſe have loſt their firſt Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by the intermixing of latter Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but think it very probable that there may be ſome ancient remains of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure ſtill left, though now not certainly to be diſtinguiſhed. And if there be not a plain poſitive Teſtimony for the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſe of Liturgies, yet Dr. <hi>O.</hi> being able to produce none to the contrary, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſage of them in all the following Ages, wherein there is a clear account of the Churches cuſtoms, ought to be a ſtrong preſumption that they followed the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent practice, in this as well as other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that the ſame reaſons which did induce St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Liturgies, did move the Primitive Fathers in or before the ſecond Century to do the like.</p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:152722:120"/>
                     <p>The ſame may be ſaid for Dioceſan and Provincial Churches, for St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was undoubtedly an Arch-biſhop and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, which does plainly infer a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and Dioceſan Church, the Canons Apoſtolical proved by learned men, to be compoſed in the ſecond Century, out of ſeattered Rules left by the Apoſtles, do evidently ſuppoſe the like; and the great Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ſpeaking of Provincial Churches, does ſay, the order of them ſhould be obſerved, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, according to the cuſtomary uſage which did then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and alſo adds, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, let the ancient cuſtoms be ſtill obſerved, and that they ſhould apply this rule to a novel alteration that had been introduced two hundred years after Chriſt, contrary to the Evangelical Inſtitution, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> does contend, cannot enter into the mind of any rational and unprejudiced man. So that theſe things conſidered, there is no equitable Judge in the World, but would give Sentence againſt Dr. <hi>O.</hi> in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and determine that 'tis highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable if not certain, that they were uſed in like manner before the end of the ſecond Century, but to be ſure, 'tis impoſſible for him to ſhew any evidence from the ſecond Century, or any time before, that the Prayers, Ceremonies, and practice of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:152722:121"/>then in uſe, are not conſiſtent with that now in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore all his Controverſie with her ought to be at an end, by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. For though ſome Biſhops had no larger Dioceſſes at firſt, than could meet in one Congregation ordinarily, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all Chriſtian Offices from their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Adminiſtration, yet that Negative that they ought to have no more, or not to have the inſpection of many particular Congregations, who have Presbyters to Adminiſter the Word and Sacraments to them, under their direction and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can no way be proved from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or the two firſt Centuries, nor is ſuch a Conſtitution any way repugnant to the Primitive Inſtitution of Evangelical Churches, but the contrary may be proved, as I have fully ſhewn in this Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>But though Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples do neceſſarily oblige them to joyn with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt not to hold ſeparate Meetings contrary to her expreſs command, yet upon a Suppoſition that they do more good than harm, and are Inſtruments to advance greater Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purity in Religion, they do and will uphold their ſeparate Congregations, and while that is allowed, the Churches Communion will be little regarded, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152722:121"/>all Hereticks, Schiſmaticks and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men will pretend the like, and our land will be crumbled into Sects and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thereupon the force of Church-Diſcipline, and the Sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication will be little regarded, and ſo the generality of the people will be bred up in Atheiſm, Ignorance and Profaneneſs, or elſe in ſuch pernicious Principles as are not only deſtructive of true Religion, but of all Government and common honeſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, and this is already ſo much our caſe, that 'tis a very difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to find out a Jury and Witneſſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt the Diſſenters, upon whoſe credit we may rely. And while men are in this temper, how eaſily are they ſtirred up by Fears and Jealouſies to any Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attempts which will be ſuggeſted as neceſſary for their own defence, or the maintaining that Liberty and Property which they will imagine is invaded; and when once the Sword is drawn, and a rude Atheiſtical, and inflamed multitude is gathered together, whoſe life is ſecure? and to what hazzards will not only our Religion, but even our Lives, Liberty and Property alſo be expoſed? Nay, may not a Papiſt get at the head of an Army of ſuch an Atheiſtical and Seditious Rabble, and by Arts and Promiſes, make them the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:152722:122"/>Inſtruments to ſettle Popery in the Nation? as there is too great reaſon to ſuſpect <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> did intend to do, when matters had been ripe to go through with it; and that being once reſtored, will quickly ſet about deſtroying the remainder of thoſe that eſcaped the fury of a Tumultuous Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, if they will not ſubmit to their obedience. So that Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may pretend what they will, that they Preach for Edification, and to reſcue Souls from dropping into Hell, but 'tis notorious, they have kept up and promoted theſe Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which do not only deſtroy Millions of Souls, but alſo endanger our Lives, the ſafety of the Nation, and the very reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion it ſelf. And if private men do thus preſume to ſet up themſelves in oppoſition to the publick Authority of the Church, 'tis impoſſible that theſe miſchiefs ſhould ever be prevented. Therefore not only Murderers, Adulterers, Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſuch Schiſmaticks as diſturb the Peace, and weaken the Authority of the Churches Diſcipline, are to be excommunicated and reckoned amongſt Heathens and Publicans, and Enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt; which does call Schiſms and Diviſions works of the Fleſh, and require nothing more ſtrictly than Peace, Order and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Church. The firſt thing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:152722:122"/>therefore to be done, to prevent the coming in of Popery, and all other occaſions of Murder, and effuſion of Blood upon the account of Religion, with the unavoidable confuſions and diſtractions which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes attend ſuch licentious practices, is effectually to ſuppreſs all Conventicles, and to require all people under moderate Penalties to attend the publick Service of God, and to allow no publick Aſſemblies, but thoſe that are authorized by lawful Authority, according to the conſtant rules of the Catholick Church, and this is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table before all the World, that publick Authority ſhould interpoſe to keep up publick Worſhip, and to prevent Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of private men, contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Prohibitions of the Government, both in Church and State, and eſpecially in ſuch a Church where Salvation may be had, and abundantly had, and where there is a publick Worſhip wherein Mr. <hi>B. and the main body of Non-conforming Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ever did, and do now think they may lawfully joyn both as to Prayers and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all Conventicles and illegal Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, under colour of Religious Worſhip are effectually taken away, and people by moderate Penalties obliged to frequent the publick Service of God. Then it would
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:152722:123"/>be convenient for the Convocation to hear the Diſſenters Objections cloſely drawn up againſt the preſent Conſtitution of our Church, that if any thing has been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted contrary to the Word of God, as it has been generally underſtood by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, or any thing contrary to the Laws and Tradition of the univerſal Church, which we do not yet believe, or any words and expreſſions which may be better explained, or with ſome verbal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, the ſame thing in ſubſtance may be retained, without the like offence, I think it very reaſonable theſe matters ſhould be ſoberly conſidered for publick ſatisfaction, and the grounds of all ſcruples be taken away. But if nothing will content men without new modelling the Government, caſting away the ancient Rites and Uſages of the Church, and leaving the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of publick order and decency to the pleaſure of every private Humoriſt, this is not a way to Peace, and prevent Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but plainly pulling down the Walls and Bullwarks ſooner to let it in.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now what have I ſaid any where, or what need I ſay in this matter, which Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> do not alſo maintain, and why do I then ſpeak more like one of <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Puny Counſellors than they? only I do not except them becauſe the Law of the Chriſtian Church, nor the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their own premiſes do not except them, and are they only to be lawleſs and ſubject to no rules, when all the World beſide, are under the power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, to coerce, reſtrain and puniſh them, if they do any thing that may occaſion <hi>any publick diſturbance, or advance any intereſt,</hi> [for though the Dr. <hi>O.</hi> does put in Forreign intereſt, yet his words, <hi>with ſundry other things of the like nature,</hi> do alſo include any Domeſtick intereſt,] <hi>that is oppoſite to the welfare of the Nation, the truth of Religion, with ſundry other things of the like nature?</hi> And then the Doctor does not only ſay, <hi>Herein lyes an ample Field wherein the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may exerciſe his power,</hi> but alſo adds, <hi>and diſcharge his duty.</hi> And Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſayes, <hi>If perſons continue obſtinate, and do more harm than good, the Magiſtrate is Ruler, and muſt reſtrain them, and deny them leave, ſo
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152722:125"/>to preach in his Dominions.</hi> So that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates according to Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> have not only power to coerce, reſtrain and puniſh Schiſmaticks and diſturbers of the Peace of the Church, but 'tis their duty ſo to do: And if it be their duty ſo to do, then the miſchief and all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequences that follow upon their neglect, will lye upon them, and what a heavy account will the Magiſtrates have to give, who ſuffer Hereticks, Schiſmaticks and Diſturbers of the publick Peace, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract and amuſe the people, and lead many thouſands into Deſtruction? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns them highly to look about them, and take care on both ſides, that they do not hinder God's Faithful and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Paſtors from doing their duty, nor yet ſuffer Hereticks and Schiſmaticks to ſeduce and diſtract their Subjects. Now to grant a Toleration, and to permit Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and a hundred Sects more, to ſet up themſelves, is to caſt off all care of Religion, and plainly to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their duty. That Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> do not allow, and will acknowledge <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> ought to be puniſhed and reſtrained, ſo that the Magiſtrates muſt conſider and take advice, who are to be allowed, and who are to be reſtrained and puniſhed. Now what wiſer method can
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152722:126"/>Magiſtrates take than ours have done, without any partiality and favour one way or another, to leave it to the mature and ſober debates of the higheſt Councils of the Kingdom, the Biſhops and Clergy in their Convocations and Synods, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral powers in the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then in their Reſolutions not to follow new devices, or be ſingular in their Conſtitutions, and different from moſt other Churches and Kingdoms, but to obſerve the orders and cuſtoms which the Laws of the general Councils, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of the Catholick Church, and which ten thouſand Clergy-men in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion approve of, and judge agreeable to the Word of God? And if Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhall contrary to this publick Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Church and State, warranted by the conſtant order of the Catholick Church, the practice of all reformed Churches, and juſtified by the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts themſelves till 1660. ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to preach, I leave it to the common ſenſe of all men that are not blinded with ſelf-intereſt, whether they do not occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſturbance, and advance an intereſt oppoſite and deſtructive to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the welfare of the Nation, and the Peace of the Church, and therefore the Magiſtrates may, and if they will diſcharge
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:152722:126"/>their duty, ought, <hi>to coerce, reſtrain and puniſh them,</hi> as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> ſayes, <hi>and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and deny them leave to preach in their Dominions,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does affirm. And therefore I have been ſo far from ſpeaking like one of <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Puny Counſellors, that any one that ſhall adviſe otherwiſe muſt be acknowledged one of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Schiſmatical Counſellors.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſatisfie the World how much I have been wronged by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in this Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and with what tenderneſs and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration I did propoſe the Execution of Penal Laws againſt Diſſenters, I will ſet down my words which principally relate to this matter.</p>
                     <p>Orig. <hi>of Plots</hi> p. 389. <q>I confeſs Papiſts and Presbyterians have under pretence of propagating their Religion, brought great confuſion upon the Chriſtian World, and have endeavoured to get Power and Wealth into their hands by ſuch Unchriſtian methods; therefore their Principles and Practices ought to be ſuppreſſed by all wayes that are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if ever men hope for Peace amongſt Chriſtians. But their Schiſmatical and Rebellious proceedings are no way to be imputed to the Church, neither will their Cruelties and Exceſs be any Argument to take away that rational Diſcipline which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:152722:127"/>Chriſtianity does command to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, as well as profane perſons. The Chriſtian Church <hi>did never teach or require that any ſhould be put to death, merely as Hereticks, or that they ſhould be cruelly tormented.</hi> But only that they ſhould be hindered from propagating their errors: <hi>And by ſuitable Penalties compelled to hear inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and conſider impartially what is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for their Conviction;</hi> neither can Diſſenters complain of any cruel uſage under the Churches Diſcipline.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again pag. 391. <q>God did endue the Apoſtles with a more eaſie way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing men than we have now; for we muſt uſe long Arguments, and make large Diſcourſes to prove what we ſay, which will need a great deal of time and conſideration for men rightly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; and therefore many out of meer ſloth, and to avoid trouble, will run away from the Church; whereas Chriſt and his Apoſtles having the power of working Miracles, they could propoſe what they had to deliver in ſhort, and then work a Miracle to convince their Auditors. Beſides the matter that was then in Controverſie was more plain and obvious, the oppoſition being chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> againſt whom
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:152722:127"/>the Arguments are moſt clear and evident; but many of our Controverſies, as to the matter of them, are not eaſie to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by all capacities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is required great ſeriouſneſs and attention to the right diſcerning of the truth, eſpecially now, when men have loſt all reverence for the Church, and will take nothing upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Superiors; therefore when the generality of mankind are careleſs and negligent, and do not take ſuch pains, and uſe ſuch conſideration as is needful, rightly to inform themſelves, one great end of Government, is to compel men to hear, and attend to ſuch inſtruction as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to bring them to the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their duty — Pag. 393. It is alſo farther to be conſidered, that amongſt the Diſſenters, in whoſe behalf a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is deſired, there is ſcarce one of an hundred, that does underſtand how the points in difference are ſtated, either by the Church or by thoſe of their own Party; but run on blindly by an implicit belief of their own Teachers, and are more led by Humour than Judgment. Can it be reaſonable then, that men ſhould be permitted thus ſtrangely to delude themſelves, and to forſake their proper Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, without ſo much as hearing or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:152722:128"/>what is required of them? This therefore ſeems to be a method more rational than any other: That men ſhould in the firſt place be obliged to give all diligent attention, to underſtand what is required of them by their lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and not without very evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, follow any private Teachers that give them contrary inſtruction.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <q>That all Chriſtian Magiſtrates ought to ſee, that none be permitted to preach publickly, or hold any Congregations, but ſuch as profeſs that Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is agreeable to the Catholick Church; for they ought to remove all ſtumbling-blocks and occaſions of error out of the way.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <q>In caſe many are diſſatisfied with the publick eſtabliſhed Religion, after they underſtand what it is; nevertheleſs, <hi>they ought to be puniſhed with reaſonable Penalties to make them better conſider,</hi> and that they may not propoſe to themſelves any Temporal advantage by their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For 'tis found by experience, that many Papiſts did go to Church in the times of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> which afterwards returned to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they were not puniſhed for it; and many Fanaticks went to Conventicles while the Indulgence continued, that before lived
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:152722:128"/>in all Obedience and Conformity to the Church. <hi>But if after all, they ſtill perſist in their error, they are not to be put to death, or cruelly tormented.</hi> And all ſuch Diſſenters ought to reſt ſatisfied with their private Devotions: And by this means all perſons may perform their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their places, and publick Tumults and Diſorders will be prevented, and a remedy provided in a good meaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ignorance and profaneneſs.</q> Now by theſe words it is evident to all unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced men, that I ſay no other than what St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did in his 48. and 50. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and which all good Chriſtians ought to ſay in the like caſe.</p>

                     <p>HAving debated the matters in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Presbyterians and Independants, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon the Principles of Scripture, Reaſon, and their own Conceſſions, I will ſhew how much they act againſt the Principles of the chiefeſt Divines alſo, that firſt ſtood up in Oppoſition to the Popiſh Corruptions, and were the great Inſtruments of ſettling that Reformation which has been called by the name of the Proteſtant Religion, though now ſhamefully pretended as a Cloak to cover over the Rebellions, Hereſies, Schiſms, and all other extravagancies which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſms of our late times have produced. Now though in the heat of Contention with the Papiſts, while they oppoſe their Superſtitious, Uſages, and abuſe of ancient Rites, they do not alwayes expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:152722:129"/>with ſuch caution as they might have done, neither were ſo careful many times to diſtinguiſh the Pious uſe which might be made of them, from the intolerable abuſe to which they were perverted, yet they have ſufficiently declared themſelves, that the Government, Conſtitutions, and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are not only lawful, but pious and profitable for the Chriſtian Church, and peaceably to be ſubmitted to by all Religious Perſons in their ſeveral Capacities.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does ſo paſſionately deſire us to conſider the Writings of the learned <hi>Bucer,</hi> writ in <hi>England</hi> and for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> I will begin with him.<note place="margin">Buceri Script. Angl. p. 565.</note> 
                        <q>Theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons were perpetual in the Church, and inſtituted in the beginning by the Holy Ghoſt—The Churches ordained their Metropolitans in every Province, every one of which was to take care of the Biſhops of the Churches of his own Province—But there was no more Authority granted them, over other Biſhops or other Churches, than that they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and preſide in all Elections and Ordinations of Biſhops, but together with the reſt of the Biſhops of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, with all of them if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or at leaſt with the neareſt, or as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:152722:130"/>many as could be preſent. — The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both concerning Doctrine and Manners, over all Clergy-men and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſons were in every Church in the power of the Biſhop and Presbyter of each Church, [The Preſbyter in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and the Biſhop in his Dioceſs.] The Judgments concerning the Biſhops, were in the power of the Provincial Council, all the puniſhments were ſuſpenſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that ſubmit to Pennance,<note place="margin">p. 566.</note> and Excommunication towards thoſe that did reject their Pennance.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And again to the ſame purpoſe.<note place="margin">p. 581.</note> 
                        <q>Since it is our Lord's pleaſure, that all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould mutually embrace and have a care one of another, the Fathers did every where as far as they could, (for all Chriſtians are but one body) appoint, that the Biſhops of every Province, ſhould meet together with the Presbyters and Deacons as often as the occaſions of the Church did require. [Which is now done at Viſitations and Epiſcopal Synods.] And ſhould inquire into the Doctrine and Diſcipline of Chriſt, that they might be adminiſtred, and flouriſh in all Churches; and that they might amend any thing that they found amiſs, and might confirm and promote what they knew to be well.</q>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:152722:130"/>
                     <p>
                        <q>But that theſe Synods might be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and orderly managed, they would have the Metropolitans, the Biſhops of every Metropolis, have the Preſidency in calling and moderating them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did lay upon theſe Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, the charge and care of all the Churches throughout their Province. That if they underſtood there was any thing that was not well inſtituted, or done by the Miniſters of the Churches, or the people, they ſhould admoniſh them of it in due time, and if they did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend by their admonition, that they ſhould call a Synod of Biſhops to correct it. For nothing of judgment was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, which they could exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe by their own Authority over the Churches, which had proper Biſhops of their own; for all the judgment over the People and the Clergy, was in the power of the Biſhop and the Presbytery,</q> [that is reſpectively] <q>but the Synod did judge the Biſhops.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>When Biſhops were to be ordained in Churches, it was appointed that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan and all the Biſhops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſhould meet together at that Church (if it could conveniently be done) and if with ſome only, not with leſs than two or three, who were to govern the Election
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152722:131"/>of the Biſhop, if it were to be then made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then at length, to ordain him to the Epiſcopal Function. All which things were inſtituted, and did prevail, that there might be a knowledge and mutual care between the Churches and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as much as was poſſible, and to drive away and remove all offences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Doctrine and Manners, and to uphold, promote, and render the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Faith, and of a Life worthy the Lord Chriſt more effectual. So that if any did recede from their office, the reſt of the Biſhops might provide relief even to the ſuſpenſion of thoſe that were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and alſo to the caſting them out of their Epiſcopal charge.</q>

                     <p>—And then concluding the order of Government,<note place="margin">Page 583.</note> he ſayes, <q>But becauſe it is altogether neceſſary, that all Clergy-men ſhould have their Keepers and Curators, as the Authority and Power of Biſhops, and alſo of Arch-deacons and all others, by what names ſoever they are called, to whom any Portion of Ruling and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Clergy is committed, is to be reſtored, ſo alſo the vigilance and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion, that no one in this order be altogether without a guard over him.</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>And then ſhewing the great miſchiefs that ariſe from the contempt of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority, he ſayes,<note place="margin">P. 852.</note> 
                        <q>There are many that are ſimple and underſtand little, who cannot direct and govern themſelves by their own diſcretion, and we all love our ſelves too much; ſo that we cannot rightly know and judge of our own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherefore unleſs we think well and highly of them whom the Lord has ſet over us, who ſhould inſtruct, exhort, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:152722:132"/>and chide us in his name, unleſs we receive their Word and Doctrine, with all fear and trembling, as the Word and Doctrine of the Lord, the obedience of Piety will never have any place in us, neither will it be able to grow up, as we ſee with our eyes, and dayly find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. For where this Authority and obſervance of the Miniſters is not, there we ſee there will be no true Church, nor appearance of Piety. And ſo it ought to be, for God will rule altogether by his Miniſters as we have demonſtrated in the third Chapter. If theſe be heard, then he is heard, if they be deſpiſed, then Chriſt and his Father are deſpiſed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And having thus written of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, upon his Death-bed he did after this manner expreſs himſelf. Sayes Mr. <hi>Car</hi> that wrote of his Death. <q>How often have I heard him deploring the Deſolation of <hi>Germany,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">P. 874, 875.</note> and that with the moſt paſſionate expreſſions, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Heaven as he prayed to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that he would have pity on his own Nation, ſo that he would not ſuffer <hi>England</hi> to fall into the ſame Vices which brought that deſtruction upon <hi>Germany</hi> long before. And that he was afraid, that in the great heat of deſire that was in many of knowing God, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:152722:132"/>reforming the Church, while Diſcipline was wanting, whereby wicked men were chaſtiſed, and order in the Miniſtry was kept up, their good endeavours could not long make any progreſs. This he did often ſay, but then moſt vehemently, when he did, as it were, like a Pious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, embrace this Church of <hi>England</hi> as a Daughter, in his Arms, and with his laſt breath commend her to the King's Majeſty and all good men, and did wiſh in our hearing, that what things he had written to the King's Majeſty concerning the Diſcipline of the Church, might find a place and ſettlement in this flouriſhing Kingdom, which was without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie a Houſe of God. And that he did hope, if that were done, that no calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no deformity could happen to this Common-wealth; but if it were not done, God would not be ſo much appeaſed with the deſire of a few to reform the Church, as he would be provoked by the wickedneſs and Luxury of many others.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And herein this Pious man was not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, but proved a fatal Prophet of our late ſad Diſaſters, for by the giddy zeal of ſome buſie Reformers in Forty one and onward, wherein Diſcipline was taken away, not only the King and Kingdom were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152722:133"/>but the Church has been almoſt over-whelmed with numberleſs Schiſms and Hereſies, and we can never hope, as that Holy man did foreſee, to avoid the like confuſion while the Authority of the Church, and all Diſcipline is ſo ſhamefully trodden under foot, and deſpiſed as it is by our Diſſenters.</p>

From whence it comes to paſs, that we do not celebrate the Holy Supper, neither in the Evening, nor in a private Houſe, neither lying along and with men only: For theſe things, concerning Time, and Place and Habit of the body in celebrating or receiving the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:152722:135"/>Lord's Supper, and of admitting Women to the Holy Communion, of the manner of our Prayers and Hymns to God, and alſo concerning Garments and other things which pertain to external decency, I do not doubt but he has given free Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to his Church, to determine and make ſuch Orders concerning theſe things, which every Church ſhall judge moſt conducing amongſt their People, to keep up and increaſe their reverence towards all ſacred things which belong unto our Lord. If therefore any Churches from this Liberty of Chriſt, and to this end, for the Edification of the Chriſtian Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, would have their Miniſters uſe any peculiar Garments in their ſacred Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, all Superſtition being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and all Levity, and all Diſſention amongſt Brethren, that is abuſe: I do not ſee certainly how ſuch Churches can be condemned as Guilty of any ſin, much leſs of having any Communion with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. Who would now condemn the Church of Impiety, if by any pure and holy conſent, they had that cuſtom that every one when he did partake of the Lord's Supper, ſhould wear a White Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as thoſe that were newly baptized formerly did.</q>

                           <q>For if any ſhould contend, that ſuch a Liberty is not permitted to any Church of Chriſt, he muſt of neceſſity confeſs one of theſe things, either that nothing is allowed to be appointed in the Churches, of which they have not the expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt; by which means they will condemn all Churches of wicked boldneſs.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152722:137"/>the publick Miniſtry of the Church, nor privately in corners to each ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Moreover, they permit no man, who is baptized, into the name of Chriſt, to withdraw himſelf from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, and uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for they who do not abide in the Communion of Chriſt, [that is, by abide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Communion of his Church] they condemn them as Apoſtates, neither do they admit them to any Honours or publick Offices. But they who joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any Sects, they drive them away from this their Perdition, by pecuniary Mulcts and other grievous puniſhments.

Neither will we Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize any wicked or Seditious Opinions, which the Catholick Church has condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to go out of my own Charge into another City, where I am not called to be a Miniſter — Wherefore we muſt not run into another man's Charge, as the Devil does ſtir up his Miniſters to run where they are not called, and pretend a fervent zeal, and that they are grieved that men are ſo miſerably ſeduced, that they will teach them the truth, and pluck thoſe that are miſled out of the ſnares of the Devil. And indeed if any out of a Pious zeal and good intention, would by ſound Doctrine, free thoſe from error which are ſeduced, yet it would give evil example by which occaſion is offered to wicked Teachers to thruſt in themſelves, by whom Satan does afterward rule and do much hurt — This is the firſt aſſault
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:152722:142"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes againſt falſe Apoſtles which run when no body ſends them, therefore a Call is not to be deſpiſed, Neither is it enough to have the Word of God and pure Doctrine, but our call muſt be certain, without which he that entereth, cometh to kill and to deſtroy.

And every Biſhop did ordain his own Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with the Colledge of his Presbyters.</q> The uſage of Preſbyters laying on of Hands in Ordination of Preſbyters, does not ſeem to have any other Original than from the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and was no other than is now obſerved in our Church. And by all that I have quoted out of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> it is evident, he does aſſent that the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Biſhops was in the Apoſtles time; that the manner of their appointment was by the Arch-biſhop, and the Biſhops of the Province; and that the Power of ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preſbyters and Deacons, was principally belonging to the Office of the Biſhop, and never done without him; and that it was well done of the Council of <hi>Loadicea,</hi> to forbid popular Elections. And though he does indeed expreſs it to be his opinion, that Preſbyters are of the ſame Order with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, yet he does confeſs, their Superiority was alwayes acknowledged in the Church from the Apoſtles dayes, and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the higheſt <hi>Anathema,</hi> that will not reverently and obediently ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Orthodox Biſhops.</p>
                        <p>So that 'tis a demonſtrative Truth, that Government by Biſhops according to the

                     <p>But as yet we are far from that happy ſtate, and in danger of having, not only our Religion, but our Lives, our Eſtates, and all deſtroyed by Papiſts or other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, or both, unleſs timely care and hearty endeavours are uſed to ſuppreſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, and diſabuſe the people, and ſo bring our Nation to holy Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, in the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Society already eſtabliſhed amongſt us. You may fancy other Intereſts, or may be wholly taken up with purſuing your particular advantages and deſigns; but while the Land is thus torn and divided, you can never be ſecure of enjoying any of theſe Bleſſings; for by reaſon of Indulgences and Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Penal Laws ever ſince Forty One, multitudes of people have grown up, that are ignorant and Atheiſtical, and mind and know little of any Religion at all; and many others that are altogether ignorant of the Principles of true Religion, and withal peeviſhly Factious and Schiſmatical, and highly prejudiced againſt the Government both in Church and State; ſo that ſcarce the Twentieth part in many Pariſhes, and moſt Corporations, do Religiouſly frequent
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:152722:153"/>the publick Prayers and Sacraments, and live as Chriſtians ought to do, and in many places never ſo much as hear any inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or regard what their Miniſters ſay unto them. And yet theſe men muſt be Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Witneſſes in all matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our Lives and Eſtates; theſe men muſt chuſe Parliament men, without whom no Money can be raiſed, nor Laws made for the neceſſary defence and ſupport of the Kingdom; and theſe are men that have Heads and Arms that may be conjured up by Seditious Pamphlets, Factious Sermons, and Lying Reports, to Dethrone and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their King, take away your Lives and Eſtates, and bring in Anarchy and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the Nation, as they have formerly done within your Memory. Can you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you rationally conſider your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hope long to enjoy what you have, and ſleep ſecure in your Beds, while Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Pamphlets thus fly abroad into every corner, and Seditious Preachers hold vaſt Meetings, to propagate Schiſmatical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples againſt the ſetled Government and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and make that the greateſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Conformity, that they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to renounce that wicked Covenant, and theſe Rebellious and Common-wealth Principles, by which they deſtroyed His late Majeſty of Bleſſed Memory, and brought
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:152722:153"/>the Kingdom to Deſolation for near twenty years? Nay, were not their Inſolencies and Rebellious Methods for theſe two laſt years, and our imminent dangers in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the ſame and greater than thoſe in Forty one? And though as yet, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has but ſhewed us the gulf in which we are like to be ſwallowed up, and given ſome reſpite to prevent theſe dangers, and the Loyal Church-men have appeared to ſhew their reſolution to ſtand by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and demonſtrated a poſſibility of ſuppreſſing theſe Factions and Tumults, yet I do not ſee any of thoſe men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or Seditious Conventicles taken away, or our Churches better filled; nor can we hope the common people will ever entertain founder Principles, while theſe things are permitted: And 'tis in vain to imagine, that thoſe men that cauſed the late diſturbance are ſunk into the ground; yet it muſt be confeſt they are at preſent ſo diſcouraged, and the Government has ſuch aſſurance from the Loyal Party, that 'tis not only poſſible, but very eaſie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all theſe dangers, if effectual care be taken to maintain the ancient Religion, and thoſe juſt Laws, which are ſo equitable, ſo wiſe, and ſo neceſſary for the publick Safety, and they he executed with Impartial Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, againſt Papiſts and all other Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

And ſuppoſe a Monarch of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Temper and Severity ſhould ſway the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Scepter, and ſhould find our Nation thus torn and divided, and perhaps the greater part ignorant and Atheiſtical, and regardleſs of any Religion; others peeviſh, humorous and ill natured, but ſpiteful, Schiſmatical and diſaffected to the publick
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:152722:155"/>Worſhip eſtabliſhed amongſt us, and very ignorant and ungrounded in any ſober Principles, how ſoon would theſe men and their Puny Levites, moſt of whoſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a Bible and Concordance gathered into incoherent Phraſes, become a prey to the Jeſuits and Fryers, who would in whole ſwarms fly about their Ears, and beſet them in every corner, and yield a new Triumph to the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquerors? It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſuch a broken, ignorant and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted people, as ours are at this time, ſhould long hold out the conteſt againſt the Learning, ſetled Order, outward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Religious Zeal, which they will then preſs upon their Conſideration, together with the Temporal advantages they will have if they ſubmit, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny threats and dangers they will incur, if they obſtinately perſiſt in that they call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and Diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>Neither will the Biſhops and the learned Clergy, and their truly ancient Catholick and pious Eſtabliſhment, be able then to ſecure theſe men or the Nation; for the Diſſenters will not deſire their help, but are taught to account them Papiſts alſo; and then the Papiſts having a much eaſier Game to purſue, will ſlight and avoid all Conteſts with them, and prey upon the weak and unſetled people, and by that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:152722:155"/>means will gain ſtrength enough by Force and Violence, without any farther diſpute, to trample them under their Feet; and ſo our Land will be again enſlaved to <hi>Rome,</hi> and all her Corruptions; and the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians and Independents do open the door, and diſpoſe our people by theſe Diviſions, to let them in.</p>
                     <p>But if thoſe be thought only remote poſſibilities, and not much to be feared, yet the growing Arms of <hi>France</hi> at preſent are very powerful, and threaten Slavery to this part of the World, and the motions of the Empire and of <hi>Spain</hi> are very ſlow to prevent it. <hi>Flanders</hi> is moſt already in their Power, and the reſt lyes at their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Holland</hi> was over-run lately in a Month; and I have been credibly informed, that the City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> had made a Golden Baſon to preſent their Keyes in to their Royal Conqueror; and how eaſily then may they be again reduced to the ſame neceſſity, when their Adverſaries are far ſtronger now, than when they made their firſt Invaſion. Theſe things muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us and our Trade; and yet by means of the Diviſions that are tolerated amongſt us, Male-contents are encouraged, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>French</hi> and Popiſh Money does hire Preachers and Penſioners to ſpend their time in Quarrels about Religion, which
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:152722:156"/>ſhould be employed in Conſults to eſtabliſh Truth and Unity, and provide for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Safety and Defence.</p>
                     <p>The only means therefore that is left to preſerve our Nation from Deſtruction, and to ſecure us from the danger of Popery, is to ſuppreſs all Conventicles whatſoever, and by ſome moderate Penalties, ſuited to every ones condition, ſo as not to ruine any body, but to oblige all to hear the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber inſtruction of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and then in a ſhort time the Body of the Nation, which are now ſloathful and lazy, and mind no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or elſe ſtrangely perverted and miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, would come to underſtand the Grounds and Principles of the true ancient, Catholick and Apoſtolick Religion, which by an uninterrupted Tradition, has been publickly taught in all Ages, confirmed by the general Councils, and now owned and approved of by all ſetled Societies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and in all Diſputes will hearken to the learned Arguments of the Pious and Orthodox Biſhops and Doctors of our Church, againſt which all the reaſoning of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will never be able to appear with any colour, and ſo they will be in no danger of being ſeduced to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church by the buſie Prieſts and Jeſuits, if afterwards tolerated to preach amongſt them.</p>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:152722:156"/>
                     <p>Being by this Method provided againſt having our people ſeduced by the Papiſts, which as yet they are in great danger of, upon the leaſt opportunity or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the next thing to be thought of, is to conſider how to prevent Violence, that thoſe be not murdered and undone, that cannot be perſwaded to ſubmit. Now to ſecure this His Majeſties gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, to confirm any Bills that were thought neceſſary to preſerve the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Religion, that did not intrench upon the Succeſſion of the Crown, do make the way very eaſie, if our People were united amongſt themſelves, and in the Religion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For Matters may be ſo ordered, that all Officers, Eccleſiaſtical, Civil and Military, and all that are employed in Power or Authority of any kind, be Perſons both of known Loyalty to the Crown, and yet faithful Sons of the Church, and firm to the eſtabliſhed Religion, and the Laws that they act by, may be ſo explained, in the Favour of thoſe that conform to the publick Worſhip and the diſcouragement of all Diſſenters, that we muſt reaſonably be ſecure from any Violence that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts can offer to force our Submiſſion. For when all our Biſhops and Clergy are under ſtrict Obligations and Oaths, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:152722:157"/>the People are guided by them; and all Officers, Civil and Military, are firm to the ſame Intereſt, and under ſevere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, if they act any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Then what probable danger can there be of any Violence or Diſturbance to force us out of our Religion, when all things are thus ſecured, and the Power of external Execution is generally in the Hands of men of our own Perſwaſion: Nay, moreover the Prince himſelf will by his Coronation-Oath be obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Laws and Liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thus eſtabliſhed. Neither is this an imaginary Fancy of mine, or wild Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, but actually ſeen in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> himſelf a ſtrict <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> and moſt of his Subjects <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and a late Duke of <hi>Zell</hi> a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, and his Subjects of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet have lived in all Love and Concord, the Laws of their Country having ſecured them from any Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</p>
                     <p>The Papiſts therefore being very well aware of this, take all the wayes they can to diſtract and unſettle the People, and eſpecially to alienate their minds from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to any Religion, that ſo they may be in a poſſibility of fixing them in theirs,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:152722:157"/>or at leaſt by degrees to get a Parliament, If ever they have a Prince to their own mind, that may aboliſh our preſent Laws, and ſettle the Popiſh Religion; and had they but once that hold again, they would leave no Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> behind to reſtore us to that happy Reformation which now we enjoy.</p>
                     <p>So that every Conventicle is a Factory here for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether they intend it or no; and all thoſe that alienate mens minds from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or promote the Relaxation of Laws, to allow men to indulge their own humour, whether it be to be lazy and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of any Religion, or elſe Schiſmatical, are (whether they deſign it or no) Agents for the Papiſts, and do that work which they have been labouring about this Forty years, and plainly diſpoſe People to be in a readineſs to embrace Popery, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their buſie Prieſts and Bigots to contrive Plots to ſettle their Religion, when they ſee the Diſſenters have ſet open ſo fair a door to let it in. Men may overlook and deſpiſe theſe matters how they pleaſe, and Diſſenters may endeavour all wayes to excuſe themſelves; but it is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively evident to all underſtanding Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we ſhall never be free from Murders, Conſpiracies, danger of Popery, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:152722:158"/>Fears and Diſtractions while Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles continue, and men are ſuffered to withdraw themſelves from the publick Religion without any check or controul. And all at laſt muſt end in Popery, the Conſequence whereof I cannot think upon, but with the greateſt Horror and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God Almighty, for the Honour of the Reformed Religion, and in Mercy to this poor Nation, open the Eyes of all that are concerned, throughly to be ſenſible, and timely to provide againſt it, before it be too late, which as yet by the Bleſſing of God may be eaſily done, and that without Cruelty, Bloodſhed, or any juſt Complaint.</p>

                  <head>THE Biſhop of <hi>ELY</hi>'s Conſtancy TO THE Church of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> AND Diligence in performing his Office.</head>
                  <p>NEXT to the Vindication of our holy Mother the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> it is moſt honourable to appear in the Vindication of the Governours alſo, who have ſpent their dayes, and grown old in her Defence, and ſuffered the loſs of all for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of her righteous Cauſe, and a good Conſcience, in the worſt of Times. And amongſt theſe, none have been more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent than that moſt learned, holy Prelate, the Right Reverend Father in God <hi>Peter</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who was an early Confeſſor for the Truth at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and has above Forty years hazarded his Life and Health in diſputing, preaching and writing for the ſame, againſt all Oppoſers both of Church and State, as often as any
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:152722:161"/>occaſion was offered either in Publick or Private. I will not recount with what Pains and Courage he aſſerted the Cauſe of the Church of <hi>Eugland</hi> in <hi>London</hi> in the height of the Rebellion, keeping up a viſible orderly and Catholick Communion in the face of the Sun, and thereby took away that Reproach the Papiſts caſt upon us at that time that our Church was loſt, and confirmed many thouſands in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſecured others from being ſeduced, and was one principal Inſtrument under God, to make way for the happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the King and Church. Neither will I at large tell the Reader how publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he confounded the Anabaptiſts, and ſo baffled the Socinians, that they quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved their Aſſembly upon it. Neither were his Labours leſs indefatigable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Quakers, Preſbyterians, Jews, Turks, and all other Diſſenters; but his Conteſts were moſt ſignal with the Papiſts, who were ſo learnedly refuted by him, that as ſoon as they underſtood his Ability, the Prieſts were forbid to engage in any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with him, and many did thereupon wholly decline it, and others were ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuked for their raſh Adventures. However this the Church of <hi>England</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Labours; many that were waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were confirmed in the Truth, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:152722:161"/>were brought back to the Church that were ſeduced by the Papiſts. Nor laſtly, will I relate how he was delivered from the Mouth of the Lion, and Paw of the Bear, all thoſe perillous Times, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Hand of the Almighty from all Harm and Violence. Theſe and many other Matters will better become an abler Pen, when he has finiſhed his Courſe, and conſummated the reſt of his Labours for the Glory of God.</p>
                  <p>But after all his unwearied Diligence in Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> undoubted Conſtancy to the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and unblemiſht Converſation in all Places and Societies where he has been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he has not been able to ſilence Malice and Detraction, therefore though a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick of his Vertues will be more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable after his Death; yet a juſt Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Honour will be neceſſary while he is alive.</p>
                  <p>Now one would think that a Man that had lived in all Integrity, and ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo faithful in the Defence of the Church, for above Forty years, ſhould need no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; and indeed he does not with any that are not malicious againſt the Church alſo, and therefore malign him for his Conſtancy and unwearied Diligence in her Defence? and perhaps Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:152722:162"/>as much contributed to ſtir up popular Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred as any, if not been the only man that has all along ſecretly inſinuated ill Surmiſes amongſt the Diſſenting Party againſt his Lordſhip, and at length publickly and broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpake it out, in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, where he ſeems to lay the greateſt load of all their Complaints upon them, and ſayes, <hi>You (above all men that I know) have effectually helpt to bring us under</hi> [thoſe hard Terms of Concord] and a little before, <hi>Is there no better way to the Churches Concord, than that which muſt cast out ſuch men as you or I?</hi> And then adds, <hi>I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that in this Book, I have told you a righter way of Chriſtian Church Concord, more divine, harmleſs and comprehenſive, fitted by Chriſt himſelf to the Intereſt of all good men, yea of the Church and all the World. I offer it firſt to you, that you and Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may ſee what it was that I deſired; and that if I err, you will faithfully detect my Error, that I may repent before I dye, and may leave behind me the Recantation of this, and all my other Mistakes and Miſcarriages, as I intend to do upon just Conviction; but do it quickly, or elſe I am not like to ſee it: And I purpoſe not to provoke you by any Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but to improve your Evidence for my ſelf.</hi>

                     <p>Now, though the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> did not publickly write againſt Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> yet out of his abundant Charity and Goodneſs towards all that expreſs any deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Satisfaction, he ſent for him, and did ſeriouſly expoſtulate with him concerning theſe Matters, why he ſhould ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

For had not they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to, and approved of the Common-Prayer, and Conſtitutions of the Church; and what did I more, than maintain that they did well in it? Would not they have
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152722:163"/>vindicated what they had done likewiſe, if it had been put to them as it was to me? Why therefore, do you ſingle out me, and oppoſe me to them, when I defended no more than they did own and ſubſcribe to, and were bound to defend it was lawful, which was all that I did?</p>
                     <p>Moreover his Lordſhip added, Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> you alſo ſay, you deſired nothing of us, but that we would lay aſide the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chancellors, and take Advice with our Preſbyters; and yet you ſingle out me, upon whom you heap the load of your Complaints, who have done both theſe things.

And then for the Laws of the Church in general, they are not made, but by the Conſent of both Houſes of Convocation; ſo that the Biſhops have adviſed with the Preſbyters in all Matters as you deſired.

                     <p>But his Lordſhip is highly to blame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not come up to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Terms of the <hi>True and only way to Concord.</hi> If his Lordſhip did not endeavour after Concord, amongſt all good Chriſtians, and promote the Peace and Unity of the Church, I ſhould confeſ he did juſtly deſerve Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Cenſure; but I am not only fully perſwaded, but can certainly prove it, that no man in the World has ſhewn greater Moderation, or laid a ſurer Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for univerſal Concord amongſt all good Chriſtians, than his Lordſhip has done; and God be thanked of late years, moſt of the Church-men are convinced by direful Experience, that his Lordſhips Catholick Principles, and primitive Moderation, are the ſoundeſt in themſelves, and neceſſary for the Churches Peace; and therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cannot but be ſenſible, that men whom he thought great Favourers of his Party, have ſhewed themſelves to be of another mind, and poured out upon him, the Authority of whole Armies of Saints and Martyrs, and invincible Reaſons,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152722:164"/>to batter down his <hi>Babel</hi> Structure, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Church, which he has ſet forth under the ſpecious name, <hi>of the True and only way to Concord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us then conſider the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s way of Concord, which is, by uniting in that ancient Catholick and Apoſtolick Faith, Doctrine, Government, Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and Order of Worſhip, which was inſtituted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, confirmed by the general Councils, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved down by the known Cuſtom and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Churches of God throughout all Ages, and approved by the primitive Fathers and Martyrs, and eſtabliſhed in this Nation for ſubſtance, ever ſince Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was firſt planted, (which was within four years after our Saviour's Aſcenſion;) and under thoſe Circumſtances and Forms, which have been eſtabliſhed by Law ever ſince the firſt Reformation; and who can deſire a better, or propoſe a more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way to Concord than this? For all wiſe men are willing to take Advice, and to hearken to the ſober Reſolutions and Counſels of grave and learned Divines, famous for their Integrity and Wiſdom. Where then can we hope to find this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than in the conſtant Tradition of the Church, and the moſt deliberate Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the primitive Fathers and Martyrs,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:152722:165"/>and the ableſt men in all Ages? Beſides, in the unanimous Profeſſion of that Society which God has choſen peculiarly out of the World, and promiſed to bleſs with his perpetual preſence, and thereupon has call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth;</hi> and aſſured us,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15. Mat. 16.18</note> 
                        <hi>that the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt it.</hi> And as it is againſt the Catholick Faith, to deny that that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is not made hitherto good, ſo it will puzzle Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s skill in Church-Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or any other mans, to ſhew that this had not been made good in the viſible, publick, undoubted Acts and Traditions of the whole Church in all Ages, from the Apoſtles time to this very moment. 'Tis needleſs to reckon up the Particulars wherein all agree, for his Lordſhips Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is the ſame which is all over the Chriſtian World.</p>
                     <p>Come we then to conſider the Concord the Biſhop maintains with all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches. Now there is not one ſetled Church, eſtabliſhed by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that he is not at Concord withall, and holds Chriſtian Communion, and would actually embrace, and receive to his Prayers and Sacraments, and count as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Myſtical Body, whereof Chriſt is the Head, though he does not agree with them in their Errors and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:152722:165"/>and only differs from them, where they depart from the Scripture and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. Why does Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then weary himſelf out with inventing new Models and Contrivances, and feigning an endleſs multitude of Scruples about Church Communion, when all the ſober part of the Chriſtian World are generally united already? And they are the great Zealots for the Pope, and ſuch furious Anti-Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Diſſenters as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that hinder all Chriſtian Concord, and ſet the World <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> a Combuſtion with their groundleſs and unneceſſary Diſputes. Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in his younger dayes, before he had well conſidered the Terms of Church Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and thoroughly underſtood the State of the Chriſtian Church, ſaw the Anti-Epiſcopal Party a prevailing Intereſt, and ſo put on a Buff Coat to become like them, when he was engaged amongſt the Rebels, againſt the King, and his Spiritual Fathers in Chriſt. And now to juſtifie the Errors of his Youth, would perſwade all the World to be of his mind, and make men believe the Breaches are irreconcileable, unleſs they will palliate his Miſcarriages, by making them the Standard of Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereas if he would be quiet, and keep within his Station, the Methods of Concord are better already than any he can
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:152722:166"/>offer, and People would be ſatisfied, and mind their buſineſs that concerns them, if he would let them alone. But then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will be inconſiderable, his Name and Books will make no noiſe; and that Cauſe that he has wrote and drawn his Sword for, will appear, indeed as it is, no better than Schiſm and Rebellion, againſt the Father of his Country, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fathers of the Church.</p>

                     <p>Though the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Parts and Judgment, indefatigable Induſtry, and Watching, ſincere Study and Prayers to Almighty God, for the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his Underſtanding, and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance unto Truth, has arrived to greater knowledge of the divine Myſteries, and a larger Comprehenſion of Theological Science, in the Scriptures and Doctrine of the Catholick Church, than moſt other men, yet he does not thereupon deſpiſe other Perſons that are far from his Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or breed any Diſturbance in other Chriſtian Societies that have not ſuch an happy Settlement, and that true ancient and Catholick Order which we have. He does ſee and ſecretly mourn for the Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſtendom, and does throughly underſtand from whence they proceed, and what are the means to make them up, and doth with all Learning and Candour, as
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:152722:171"/>occaſion is offered, endeavour to convince and perſwade Perſons that differ from the Catholick Order, to promote the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Settlement of it, in order to the Churches Peace. Thus he has laboured with Scholars of the <hi>Greek, Ruſſian, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, French, Dutch, Lutheran,</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi>-Churches; and they all go away ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſatisfied with his Charity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Learning, Goodneſs, and pious Zeal for univerſal Concord. And were there more that did uſe the like Religious Care to promote Catholick Order, as well as Catholick Charity, Differences would be quickly made up. But ever now and then there riſes up a Great man or more, that out of profound Prudence as they think, or Popularity rather, are not contented to ſhew Charity to their Perſons, but procure Favours and Indulgences for their Errours and Humours; when with greater Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them and the Church in general, they might both encourage them, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their ſingular Wayes and Defects. This has been too too apparent all along, and has held up the Hearts of Diſſenters in their Separation, and from uniting with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which otherwiſe they would have done long ago. But finding ſuch ſecret Abetters of their Cauſe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, they hope one day, to be Maſters of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:152722:171"/>the Field again, and ſo they prepare and ſtrengthen their Party for ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>But though the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> does ſee and lament theſe unhappy means of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating Diviſions, and his Counſels and Labours have not their good effect, he does not thereupon reject Communion with thoſe that differ from him, uſe any violent or unlawful wayes to force them to be of his mind, ſend Emiſſaries abroad to embroil and diſturb their Peace and Quiet, or preach or write bitter Invectives againſt them, and endeavour to expoſe them to popular Hatred,<note place="margin">Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, Pag. 486.</note> or ſtir up foreign Princes, by Sword and War to root them out; as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did ſtir up thouſands to engage in that War, where they were bound by a ſolemn League and Covenant, and ſworn to extirpate the Government of Epiſcopacy, and is ſo far from repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he ſayes, if the like Caſe ſhould happen, he ſhould do the ſame again. <hi>Nor dare I repent of it, nor forbear the ſame, if it were to do again in the ſame ſtate of Things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, how can any man in the World proceed with more Candour and Wiſdom than his Lordſhip has done? he is bound in all Conſcience and Duty to God, to uſe all honeſt and lawful Endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:152722:172"/>the Settlement of ancient, Apoſtolical and Catholick Order, and never to conſent to any thing, whereby it may be hindered or aboliſhed; but if Reaſons, Arguments, and Perſwaſions will not prevail with men, to agree with the Catholick Church in all things, he does, notwithſtanding, bleſs God for their Agreement in the ſubſtantial Truths, and own them for Chriſtians, and for the reſt, leaves them to their own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and prayes God to unite them and his whole Church in all Truth. And if all other Churches and Divines walk by this Rule, and ſhew the ſame Moderation, as all ought to do, all Chriſtian Churches would be at peace one with another all over the World, and we ſhould hear of no more Wars and Commotions to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Religion, nor any Animoſities or Plots to breed diſturbance amongſt Churches that differ from one another. But this is the irreconcileable Temper of the Papiſts and the Anti-Epiſcopal Party with their Adherents, that they will not be ſatisfied with our Charity to their Perſons, unleſs we will make them our Maſters alſo, and ſwallow down all their Novelties and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Which is juſt as if a man that had a lame Leg or a Wen, ſhould refuſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Converſation with others, becauſe they will not break their Legs, and mangle their

                     <p>And now we are come to the Point, whereupon Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his Anti-Epiſcopal Party raiſe their great Out-cries againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> as being rigorous and ſevere towards Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But which way, or wherein can they ground any Complaint againſt his Lordſhip, more than againſt any other man? Firſt, if they blame the ſeverity of Laws, and terms of Communion, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all concern his Lordſhip; for he was not preſent at the making of them, nor had any Authority in the Church to hinder them when they were made, but was a Subject, and bound to ſubmit to them as well as other men. Neither can they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his Lordſhip of any Rigour in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them above others; no man has been ruin'd or undone, no man has ſuffered any cruel or hard Uſage by his Lordſhips means. Though he has been ſevere to himſelf, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many Journeys, impaired his health and his ſtrength in Preaching, and labouring to inform and convince Diſſenters and others; yet he has not given them any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:152722:173"/>to complain of hard Uſage or Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards them. And though he is Juſtice of Peace by Act of Parliament, yet he never did act any thing in that Office againſt Diſſenters or others, ſince he came to his Dioceſs. So that there is nothing in any kind, that Diſſenters can lay to his Charge, but they muſt confeſs they are treated by him, and diſcourſed withall with the greateſt Tenderneſs, Charity and Moderation. Any thing of Modeſty and Goodneſs that appears in them, is cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and commended; any thing of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Indiſcretion, is eaſily pardoned and overlookt; no advantage is taken of a haſty Word, or misbecoming Behaviour; any thing but intolerable Errour and Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is preſently forgiven. This all that know his Lordſhip do well underſtand and are convinced of; and for others that do not know him, if they think ill of him, there is no excuſe for them; ſince not only the duty of Chriſtian Charity, but common Humanity does oblige all perſons, not to harbour any ill opinion of any man, till they have ſure Evidence he does deſerve it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not therefore any thing that his Lordſhip has ſaid or done, but only his being a Biſhop of profound Learning and Acuteneſs, exemplary Piety in his whole
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:152722:173"/>Life and Converſation, and indefatigable Induſtry in Preaching, and ſtopping the mouths of all Gainſayers by his unblemiſht Reputation, that has made Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the Diſſenters expreſs their Diſpleaſure againſt his Lordſhip; as ſome ſaid at a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee at <hi>Tunbridge</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> before whom his Lordſhip was brought before his Exile from <hi>Cambridge: That he was indeed a man of a very good Life and Converſation, the more was the pity, for ſuch men did all the Harm.</hi>

                     <p>Though the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Charity be ſo diffuſive, and his Chriſtian Moderation does extend to hold Communion with all Chriſtian Churches in the World, yet his Love of Truth and Zeal for Catholick Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, does teach him, not to communicate with them that deny the Catholick Faith, or break Catholick Unity.

                     <p>It was not my Deſign, when I wrote firſt, to contend with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or any body elſe, or to raiſe any new Diſputes or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, but to promote Love and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt all Chriſtians, and to put an end to that unnatural Cruelty and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with which they perſecute and deſtroy one another; and thereupon I did demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively prove, that the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Church, were alwayes contrary to theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Methods, and that they were the zealous Defenders of the Pope's uſurpt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over all Chriſtians, and the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Fanaticks or Anti-Epiſcopal Party, that have thus filled Chriſtendom with Blood and Confuſion. And this I made ſo plain to common Senſe, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> nor no body elſe is able to gain-ſay it.</p>
                     <p>And as he cannot deny that the Papiſts, and Anti-Epiſcopal Party, have gone about by Blood and Violence, to deſtroy the Church of <hi>England,</hi> contrary to all Law and Juſtice, ſo neither does he go about to diſprove me, when I maintain, that it is the Law of the Goſpel, and the conſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Chriſtian Church, that all Perſons, as well Clergy as Lay-men, muſt live in Obedience and Communion with their own Biſhops, as long as they profeſs the Catholick Faith, and uphold ſuch a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:152722:177"/>Worſhip wherein it is lawful to joyn, and in the right performance whereof, we may obtain Salvation. And that our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Service of God is ſuch, I have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhewed in this Book, and even from Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own Confeſſion. So that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively certain, that this Separation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and holding Conventicles contrary to Laws both of Church and State in this Nation, is Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, according to the Doctrine of the ancient Fathers, and all approved Councils General and Particular, and the conſtant Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Church in all Ages.</p>
                     <p>This is a Point, upon which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not willing to joyn Iſſue; and he muſt needs be ſenſible, that modeſt and ſober men of his Party would very much ſtartle, if they were once convinced of this Truth; and therefore he does all he can to obſcure the Matter, and would fain lead the Diſpute away from the preſent Queſtion, into the Debate of the Nature, Authority, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of General Councils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is nothing at all to our preſent Differences, neither ſhall I require Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to be of my mind about them, if he will but obſerve thoſe Rules of Unity which the Goſpel has laid down. For, if there never had been any General Councils, yet Chriſtians muſt
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:152722:178"/>have lived in Obedience to their lawful Paſtors; and there would have been ſome orderly Methods of Church-Communion; and I make uſe of the Authority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, as an external Means to know what were the Rules of Communion the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans held, to preſerve Unity and Order, and to prove that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in maintaining Conventicles, acts contrary to them, and plainly ſets up a Schiſm in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Nay, there is not one Point, that I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, about the Terms of Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, wherein Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does not agree with me in general, as his words quoted above do ſhew; but only he is angry, I do not ſtill make an Exception for him and his Party.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I proceed to the particular Exceptions he makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: And firſt,</p>

                        </note> or particular Churches give offence by Hereſie, Schiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Church Univerſal, or the reſt of the Biſhops, may reprove them for it, and then there is no Reaſon, why one man ſhould be cenſured, and many ſhould go free; and conſequently our Saviour has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Authority of his Church over all Chriſtians, as well particular Churches as private men; and if they neglect to hear the Church, let them be unto thee as an Heathen man and a Publican; and as this is a rational and neceſſary Inference from our Saviours words, ſo the Scripture elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where does plainly tell us, that Churches of Kingdoms and Nations, have a Soveraignty over them, to which they muſt yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 60.12. where the Prophet ſpeaking of the Chriſtian Church, ſayes, <hi>The Nation and Kingdom that will not ſerve thee ſhall periſh, yea, thoſe Nations ſhall be utterly waſted.</hi> If Nations and Kingdoms muſt ſerve the Church, than ſhe has Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:152722:179"/>to command their Obedience in things that belong to her Peace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>And as the Church, in her diffuſive Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, has Authority to teach her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the heavenly Truth, ſo in her collective Repreſentatives in a General Council, ſhe has power to decide Controverſies, and provide for good Order and Unity. And this is evident from <hi>Acts</hi> the <hi>15th.</hi> where we read, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> two inſpired Apoſtles, went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to conſult the Apoſtles and Elders, about a Queſtion that aroſe in their Time, and there was a Council held, and the Controverſie was decided by it, and the Decrees were ſent about, not as the Decrees of the Apoſtles only, who were divinely inſpired, but as the Act of the whole Church. Ver. 22. <hi>Then it pleaſed the Apostles and Elders with the whole Church, to ſend, &amp;c.</hi> For becauſe the indefectible Authority of deciding Controverſies, was not to reſide in every ſingle Biſhop, the Apoſtles to give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample how Controverſies ſhould be ended in future Ages, did not decide it by their infallible Spirit only, but proceed in an ordinary Method, plainly countenancing the Authority of Councils, and intimating to us, that all Chriſtian Poople ought to ſubmit to their Decrees. Accordingly the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:152722:179"/>Chriſtian Church has challenged ſuch an Authority, and has held ſuch Aſſemblies as occaſion did require; and ſix ſuch have been approved, and received generally in the Church, and no more. For the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Councils, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Lateran, Lyons, Conſtance, Baſil</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> have been ever rejected by the Eaſtern Churches, and ſo there can be no pretence to account them General Councils. And as for Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Exception, why we do not own the ſecond of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Nice,</hi> for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils alſo? I anſwer, becauſe they were at the time they were firſt held, and many years after, accounted no Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, and not received for ſuch by the Church. And the ſecond of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is plainly rejected at this very day, and has been from its firſt Diſſolution. And ſo was the ſecond of <hi>Nice,</hi> for a long time, by the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, and the Church has never yet met ſince, to confirm its Authority. See my <hi>Orig.</hi> of Plots, p. 243. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> objects farther, <hi>The</hi> Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Jacobites, Abaſſines, <hi>&amp;c. renounce ſome of the ſix Councels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They had indeed a profound Veneration for the Perſons of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> and thereupon did believe them, when they ſaid, that the Councils were miſtaken
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:152722:180"/>in Matter of Fact, and condemned them for Opinions which they did not own, and thereupon did reject thoſe Councils; but they did not then, nor do not at this day, reject the Catholick Faith,<note place="margin">See <hi>Breer-woods</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, p. 183. And many others that write of thoſe Churches.</note> and the Rules of Chriſtian Unity, which are contained in the ſix General Councils; ſo that in effect they do own them; for the principal Thing that is required, is to profeſs the true Faith, and hold the Unity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace and Righteouſneſs of Life, which thoſe Churches do, in as much as they profeſs to own the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitane</hi> Councils, and do not deny the Doctrines defined in the other Four.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> demands, <hi>But how ſhall any man's Conſcience be ſatisfied, that just theſe ſix had a Supream, &amp;c?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the publick Acts of the Church, as we are ſatisfied of our Acts of Parliament, for there are no more generally received, and there are.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> Ob. <hi>Did the Catholick Church dye or ceaſe, after the ſixth General Council?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Eſſence of the Catholick Church, does not conſiſt in the being of a Council; ſhe would have exiſted, if there never had been any General Council, and does exiſt now there is none. The Meeting of the Paſtors in Council, is but an external Means for better declaring the Catholick Faith,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:152722:180"/>and holding of mutual Correſpondence and Underſtanding, between the ſeveral Churches. And the ſeveral Churches, God be thanked, have by this means been kept united in the Faith, amidſt all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and Diviſions ever ſince, and agree to it at this very day. Nay, all thoſe Schiſms and Maſſacres that have happened in the Church, have been carried on, and are ſtill upheld by trampling down, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Authority of the Catholick Church and General Councils. Firſt, by the Papiſts, in ſetting the Pope above a General Council, and then burning and deſtroying all thoſe that will not ſubmit to his Determinations. Secondly, by the Anti-Epiſcopal Party, who ſaw no other way to compaſs their Deſigns, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the Authority of the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and General Councils, which they ſaw were plainly againſt them, and did condemn their Proceedings; and ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves up above them, do make a Pope in every Pariſh or Independent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> goes on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It's a doleful thing to think on what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts all theſe expect, that all Christians Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhould be ſatisfied,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It is a doleful thing indeed, to think how they ſhould be ſatisfied that ſet up a Pope in every Congregation, and follow
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:152722:181"/>him in Oppoſition to the Catholick Church and General Councils. And 'tis a much more doleful thing, to conſider how Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who knows he does this, and deludes the poor People into ſuch an unreaſonable Diſobedience, ſhould ſatisfie his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, 'tis paſt my skill to underſtand how he can; or how he can hope to quiet Hereſies and Schiſms in the Church, when the Authority of ſix General Councils, and the conſtant Practice and Doctrine of the Church in all Ages is ſet at nought by-him, in compariſon of his private Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But beſides theſe Scriptures already al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, I deſire Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to conſider the Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Reaſon of the thing in the light of nature. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32, 33. <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets. For God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints.</hi> Now if Prophets divinely inſpired, to prevent Confuſion, are ſubject to other Prophets, and God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, in all the Churches of the Saints, the force of this Text, and the Dictates of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon do teach us, that if Hereſies and Schiſms do ariſe to diſturb the Churches Peace, the Spirits of private men and private Paſtors, muſt be ſubject to the Deciſions of the reſt of the Paſtors, and the Major part of the

                     <p>Would not any one ſtand amazed at theſe words of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s, when there is no more required of him, than what he does know and profeſs to be lawful a thouſand times over in all his Writings? For what do we require of him or any body as a Condition of our Communion, but to live in Obedience to thoſe Governours, and joyn in that Worſhip which the prudence of God in a peaceable manner, according to the Laws Eccleſiaſtical and Civil of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has ſetled amongſt us, and which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does often joyn in, and ſayes, it was the Judgment of the main body of the Non-conformiſts, as far as ever he could learn,<note place="margin">Apol. p. 8.</note> that it was lawful ſo to do? is this to condemn them as Schiſmaticks, for not obeying they know not whom or what? And though we do <hi>ex abundanti</hi> urge the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters with the Authority of General Councils, and the conſent of the Chriſtian
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:152722:184"/>Church in all Ages, to ſhew the Piety of our Conſtitutions; yet we require not him, or others, to aſſent to any number of General Councils, or any thing about their Authority, as a Condition of our Communion, but only to live peaceably in that Communion which he ſayes is lawful, and which the Word of God, as well as the Rulers of the Church, oblige him to</p>
                     <p>Neither is there any Church in the World that we condemn or ſeparate from; their Errours and Corruptions we do condemn, and I hope there is no harm in that; nay, we are ſo far from cutting off moſt of the Catholick Church for Schiſmaticks, that we condemn none for Schiſmaticks, but thoſe that are condemned for Schiſmaticks by all Churches in the World. For not only the <hi>Greek, Abyſſine, Ruſhian</hi> Churches, but the Proteſtant Churches do all with one conſent, condemn them for Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks which ſeparate from the lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of any True Church (where the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rightly adminiſtred to them,) and ſet up Churches againſt Churches, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion againſt Communion, not only without the Leave, but contrary to expreſs Laws both of Church and State. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Schiſm in the Opinion of all Churches, 'tis the Duty of all Chriſtian Magiſtrates,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:152722:185"/>who are Nurſing Fathers of the Church, to ſee that their Children be not led into Schiſm, and have no Temptations to draw them into Sedition, Strife and Diſobedience, which they will have, if ſchiſmatical Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers be ſuffered to ſet up themſelves contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all Authority, and inſinuate what they pleaſe amongſt the People to diſturb the Government both of Church and State. We do well therefore to put the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in mind, that it is their duty, as nurſing Fathers, to hinder ſuch Seducers from corrupting their Children, and to preſerve that Order which all other Churches require as well as ours. Again, there are abundance of lazy, ignorant, erroneous, and profane Perſons in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that are baptized and under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Care; to theſe he ought to be alſo a nurſing Father, and provide Food for their Souls, and therefore compel them to hear ſober and wholſome Inſtruction, which out of lazineſs and humour they will not do, but rather live in Ignorance and Errour; and does it not well become Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s Humility, and every Pious man, to call upon Magiſtrates to act the part of a nurſing Father, in taking care of ſuch care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Children? And does not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſay, that Magiſtrates ought to uſe this care? See above Chap. 24. and why does he then ſay,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:152722:185"/>'tis ſuch a doleful thing for me and others to ſay ſo, as well as he? All the miſchief of it ſtill is, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will offend, but he is angry that we do not except him and his Party from puniſhment.</p>

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:152722:186"/>So that theſe Churches may agree with us in the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and be received to our Communion, though they differ from us about the Number and Nature of General Councils. And as I ſaid above, the four latter Councils, do not require the Profeſſion of any other Faith, or other terms of Unity than the two firſt; ſo that Communion may be held with them, notwithſtanding that difference about the Authority of this or that Council.</p>
                     <p>And that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhould charge me with denying Communion with theſe Churches, and cutting off as Schiſmaticks, moſt of the Catholick Church, is very ſtrange, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he takes notice of theſe Words of mine, p. 198. <hi>But he ſeems to be of a larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, when</hi> p. 344, 345. <hi>he ſaith.</hi> 
                        <q>We are in Charity and hold Communion with all good Chriſtians (excepting as above excepted, the fundamental Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Jeſuited part of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and other Churches) throughout the World.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words fully vindicate me; but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſayes, <hi>The doubt is, whom you will take for good Chriſtians in your degree of Charity?</hi> But this can be no doubt to any that conſiders theſe words, much leſs to one that has read my Book, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſeems to have done.

                        <hi>the Jeſuited part of the</hi> Roman <hi>and other Churches,</hi> I did plainly enough comprehend ſome of all other Churches within my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but I put in the words, <hi>good Chriſtians,</hi> to exclude evil Livers, and thoſe that do not walk according to their Profeſſion, with whom Governours ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, till they profeſs their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But I need not go about to infer this by conſequence, for in that very Page quoted by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in the words immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foregoing, I had ſufficiently prevented his doubt. <q>Thoſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, are never refuſed our Communion, ſo long as they profeſs the Catholick Faith and Worſhip.

And in the ſame Page, before we may communicate with thoſe of the Reformed, <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Churches, if they profeſs the Faith, and ſincerely joyn in the Service of God, contained in our Common-Prayer, though they have ſome private Errours which are contrary to ſome of our Articles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>The ſtrangeſt Suppoſition yet, which I find in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is p. 199.6. <hi>Yea, I would understand whether you renounce not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and most of the preſent Conformists, as Schiſmaticks, as well as Non-conformiſts?</hi> Again p. 201. <hi>That which I now note is, that you judge the True former Church of</hi> England <hi>Schiſmaticks, and ſeparate from them as none of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what colour Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has to judge ſo, I do not know; no words of mine, nor Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, do ſhew any ſuch thing, nay both are quite contrary. And whereas he quotes ſeveral of the Articles, thinking from thence to prove ſomething againſt me; I will aſſure him there is nothing in them, which I do not heartily aſſent unto; neither do they contain any thing contrary to what I have written in this or any other Point,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:152722:187"/>and I wiſh Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and the Non-conformiſts did as heartily joyn with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to her publick Laws and Conſtitutions as, I do; and then all our Diſputes about Schiſm would be at an end. Beſides, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> cannot but know, if he would conſider, that this is altogether a groundleſs ſurmiſe; for if a man lives ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and comes to our publick Worſhip, no body does trouble him to know what his Opinions are, about General Councils, or ſuch like Matters. Did Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ever hear that Biſhop <hi>Sparrow,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Thorndick,</hi> or I, did ask any Communicant before we gave him the Sacrament, whether he did believe there were ſix General Councils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why then ſhould he fancy ſuch a thing?

So that 'tis quite a different thing to deny the Faith of any of the General Councils, from diſ-believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or doubting about the Authority or number of General Councils. And if I had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the dayes of Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot, Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does often object againſt the maintaining of an uninterrupted Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Epiſcopal Ordination, and now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly does urge it againſt me. I will ſet down his words, p. 201. <hi>You utterly diſable King or Biſhop, or Convocation, from chooſing a Biſhop or Priest that ſhall have any Power: For by you, neither King, nor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, nor Clergy, nor People, can call any man with power to the Miniſterial Work, that hath not had an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Dioceſan Ordination, which no People can know, but in moſt places know to the contrary.</hi> But why does Mr. <hi>B.</hi> quarrel at an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Succeſſion, as if he does not, or at leaſt ought not, to maintain it as well as I, when it may be had? And then, why does he ſay that I diſable a King, a Biſhop, or Convocation, from chooſing a Biſhop or Prieſt, that ſhall have any Power, any more than he, or any other man? For has not God promiſed there ſhall be Paſtors alwayes to the end of the World? And then is not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> bound to maintain, that God has and will make good this promiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where?
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:152722:189"/>And therefore he, as well as I, will be obliged to ſeek after an uninterrupted Succeſſion, and make uſe of it where it may and is probably to be had, nay aſſuredly had, as much as we can, be ſure, in things of that Nature, if we will take care to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our ſelves; and as much as any man can be ſure of his Genealogy, or a Jew could be ſure that our Saviour was born of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> I ſuppoſe then, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not turn <hi>Erastian,</hi> and ſay, that though there be Biſhops and Prieſts, that have had Ordination by Succeſſion, yet the King, or a Patron, may appoint a Lay-man to be a Prieſt, or a Biſhop, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Ordination, ſo much as by a Prieſt; but where there are Preſbyters, he will ſay, and a Patron may have a Perſon ordained by them, he ought to derive his Prieſtly Office by Authority from ſuch Preſbyters at leaſt; and ſo an <hi>Eraſtian</hi> will ſay, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does utterly diſable a King, or Patron from chooſing any Prieſt that hath not an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Succeſſion, as well as I. But this is the difference, he will require a Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that began an hundred and fifty years ago, or perhaps not fifty; and I require a Succeſſion that began from Chriſt and his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Matt. 28.</note> and was ever owned and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained till this very day, and which God has promiſed ſhall continue to the end of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:152722:190"/>the World. And Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will find it a very hard Matter to prove that this Succeſſion of Biſhops was interrupted in any Age, or that there were many counterfeit Biſhops; for a Biſhop's Ordination is generally ſo open and notorious, that few Cheats have happened or could happen in that kind. And ſince there are ſo many Biſhops that have a viſible Succeſſion, 'tis an eaſie matter for any man that has a mind, to be aſſured of the Epiſcopal Ordination of the Perſon he makes choice of; or if he doubts or knows to the contrary, to have that ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple taken away. So that here is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty put upon any body in this Caſe. For if a man can have a Biſhop or a Prieſt, that has Epiſcopal and undoubted Ordination, what wiſe man would not rather chooſe it, than any other uncertain way, or that which is moſt probable to be ſo? If he cannot have ſuch a one, or is impoſed upon by a Counterfeit, without his knowledge, God will accept what he has, till he knows the Cheat, and gives him an Opportunity of a better Supply; and then he ought to follow the Regular way, and there can be no excuſe for his neglect. And this is the Caſe of all thoſe that would exerciſe the Prieſtly Office amongſt us; where there is an uninterrupted and an undoubted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and Biſhops and Prieſts thus duely
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:152722:190"/>ſetled throughout the Kingdom. And as for other Churches that want a regular Succeſſion, either they can have it, or they cannot. If they cannot, though they deſire it, God, as I ſaid, will accept what they can have, and excuſe the reſt. But if they might, but will not amend this defect, 'tis a great Errour in thoſe that neglect and hinder the Reſtauration of the ancient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and I ſhall leave them to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Lord and Maſter; but I ſhall think charitably of the Generality of the People in thoſe Churches, and receive them to my Communion, who profeſs and live up to the Catholick Faith, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in their Confeſſions, and either do not know, or cannot help their Defects at home. So that all that I contend for in this Matter is, that the Order of Biſhops, and Epiſcopal Ordination by an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Succeſſion, ought to be maintained where it is to be had. And Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is for caſting of it away where it may be had, or at leaſt ſetting up another Order never approved for fifteen hundred years, to be equal to it. That is a thing I ſtill do and muſt inſiſt upon; and no Criticiſms and private Interpretations can give colour to the erecting of a new Power of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that was never allowed, nor thought valid for fifteen hundred years, when
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:152722:191"/>the ancient Order may be obſerved.</p>

                        <q>Though we do thus think charitably of many in other Churches, and do glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive them to our Communion, which is pure and Catholick, yet we muſt not joyn with them in, or approve of their Errors and Defects. Therefore if they would permit us to communicate with them in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out renouncing our own Communion, (which I know their Schiſmatical Pride will never allow them to do) yet whileſt their Errors and Superſtitions are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with their Service, we cannot joyn with them in the good Things which they ſtill retain, but we muſt joyn with them in their Corruptions alſo, which is unlawful to do.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then beſides what I have ſaid already of my Communion with the Reformed Churches; yet farther to confirm how groundleſly Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does charge me with rejecting them, I deſire the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what I wrote, p. 337. <q>Since all Reformed Churches, that ſtand eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by any ſetled Authority, do own the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for the ſence of them do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:152722:192"/>lay down the Interpretation of the Catholick Church, to be the Meaſure they will be ruled by; and not only ſo, but even do actually embrace all the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Faith contained in the Creeds, and all other Points abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; therefore I do ſee no Reaſon, but we ought to grant a poſſibility of Salvation to ſome in all theſe Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though they are guilty of many leſſer Errors and Defects. And thus much is ſaid by the moſt Reverend Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>

                     <p>Thus I have anſwered all the Objections of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> againſt me, Chap. 5. beginning at p. 193. and therein I think I have anſwered the Matter of his whole Book, but the other ſeveral parts thereof, I doubt not, will be ſufficiently anſwered by his two learned Adverſaries, againſt whom they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

                     <head>What is the Catholick Churches ſenſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning holding Communion, and being a Member of the Catholick Church.</head>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſayes, P. 182. <hi>It greatly concerns all Chriſtians to know what the Catholick, that is, what the Chriſtian univerſal Church is, becauſe it is that which every Chriſtian muſt be, and is a Member of, and it is an Article of our Creed. Had Mr.</hi> Thorndike, <hi>Mr.</hi> Dodwell, <hi>Biſhop</hi> Gunning<hi>'s Chaplain truly defined it, they had not been to blame for laying ſo great ſtreſs on that Article, and calling us all to unite in the Catholick Church.</hi> Now if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did really mind the Peace of the Church, and not the upholding of a Party, he cannot but be ſenſible that I did ſpeak fully to this Matter; for though I did not, like a Catechiſt, explain the Notion of the Catholick Church, yet I did ſufficiently ſatisfie the Reader in all Points about it, that concern our preſent Peace and Unity, which was the Deſign of my Writing. For our Churches Peace has been diſturbed by two Parties. Firſt by the Papiſts, who refuſe to joyn with us, becauſe we deny ſubjection to the Pope and his Councils. Secondly, by the Anti-Epiſcopal Party that deny Obedience to our Biſhops and Provincial National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:152722:196"/>Three things therefore I had to make good, to bring theſe Diſſenters to the Communion of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, That it was moſt reaſonable, that in all Controverſies wherein the Peace of the Church was diſturbed, they ſhould hearken to the Order and Cuſtom of the univerſal Church, or the main Body of Chriſtians, rather than the private Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of their own Parties. And I ſhewed that all Churches did agree to this Rule, and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was eſtabliſhed according to it.</p>
                     <p>Then I had but two things more to do to procure this Union, both which I did ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually make good. Firſt, that there was no Law or Tradition of the Univerſal Church, to require us to obſerve any of thoſe corruptions or defects of the <hi>Roman</hi> or other Churches, rejected by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Articles and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it was the conſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the univerſal Church, that all private Chriſtians and Miniſters muſt live in obedience to their Biſhops and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Synods, while they did keep to the general Rules of the univerſal Church, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> had done.</p>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:152722:196"/>
                     <p>Now Mr. <hi>B.</hi> yields the two former Points, and ſo much of the Third, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a True Church, and that 'tis lawful to communicate with her in her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Service,<note place="margin">See Apol. p. 8.</note> and that 'tis unlawful to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from her; but quarrels with me for not making a Scholaſtical Definition of the Catholick Church, for him to run Diviſion upon, and confound his Reader. But I did over and over ſhew, that it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Doctrine of the Catholick Church; that for Prieſts and others to be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, and Members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, it was neceſſary that they ſhould yield Obedience to that Biſhop and Provincial Church under which they live, if they did keep to the Rule of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and had a publick Service wherein they might lawfully joyn, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and the Non-conformiſt Miniſters own ours is. So that for the Papiſts, upon pretence of obeying the Pope and his Canons, and the Anti-Epiſcopal Party, under pretence of purer Worſhip and greater Edification, to ſet up another Communion without, and contrary to the Command of the Biſhops and Provincial Synods of this Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, is Schiſmatical, according to the received Doctrine of the univerſal Church; and therefore in order to their being in Communion with, and ſound Members
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:152722:197"/>of the Catholick Church, they muſt leave off their private Conventicles, whether Popiſh or Preſbyterian, and heartily joyn and ſubmit themſelves to their reſpective Biſhops and Pariſh-Miniſters, as long as they maintain that Catholick Faith and Worſhip now eſtabliſhed amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>This being aſſented to, will quiet all our Diſſentions at home, and by the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will oblige all other parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, to ceaſe troubling us, and ſo will ſet us at Peace with all other Churches abroad alſo. For as our own People muſt yield all Love and Obedience, ſo all others, as well Clergy as Lay-perſons, muſt ſhew all Love and brotherly Friendſhip to us, and we the like to all others that keep to the ſame general Rule, as far as they are able, and their Circumſtances will admit; and this being the main Point in Difference between Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and me, I ſhall endeavour farther to ſhew this is the Scripture Rule, and the Doctrine of the Catholick Church. And the Proof hereof will ſuffice, inſtead of all other Diſputes about the legiſlative Power, the Nature, Number, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils.</p>
                     <p>And firſt the Scripture Rule is, <hi>To obey them that have Rule over us,</hi> Heb. 13.17. as the Biſhops of that place where we live have. And then becauſe Differences and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:152722:197"/>Diſputes may ariſe, we are told, that <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, for God is not the Author of Confuſion but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.32, 33.</p>

And they do flatter themſelves in vain, who being not at Peace with the Biſhop, do creep up and down, and think they have a private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with ſome of their own Party.

                     <p>Idem in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Anarchy is ill every where, and the Foundation of a great many Calamities, and the beginning of Diſorder and Confuſion; but it is much more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Church, in as much as the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greater and higher. If you take away the Shepherd from the Sheep, you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and destroy all. Anarchy therefore is evil, and the Foundation of Deſtruction. And diſobedience of Inferiors is no leſs, for the ſame is done again; for a People that do not obey their Governour, are like to them that have none, and perhaps worſe, for there they have ſome excuſe.</hi> — [Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your

But how do you mean wicked? if it be upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Faith, fly from him, and reject him, not only if he were a man, but though he were an Angel come down from Heaven; but if it be in Matter of his Life, do not trouble your ſelf. And this I do not ſay of my ſelf, but from the Holy Scripture; for hear Christ ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the</hi> Scribes and Phariſees ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Seat, <hi>&amp;c. Matt.</hi> 23. <hi>Do not regard their Life but their Words, for no body can be hurt by their ill Manners. Why ſo? becauſe they are manifeſt to all, neither will he, though he do wickedly ten thouſand times, teach wicked things. But upon the account of Faith, becauſe that is not ſo manifeſt to all, and a wicked man will not ceaſe to teach his wicked Doctrine.</hi>

                     <p>And that the Canons of the Church Ancient and Modern,<note place="margin">See them quoted in my ſerious Enquiry into the Means of a happy Union.</note> both of general and particular Councils require the ſame, is ſo evident, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had no way to avoid the force of their Authority, but by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Church-Hiſtory, on purpoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace both the ancient Biſhops and their Councils. And how he hath handled the Matter, I refer the Reader to his Anſwerer that has wrote in their Vindication; and will only quote one Canon at preſent of the univerſal Church: <hi>Can.

                        <hi>If any Presbyter or Deacon, deſpiſing his own Biſhop, ſhall ſeparate himſelf from the Church, and ſhall hold a private Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and ſet up an Altar, and diſobey his Biſhop when he calls for him, and will not hearken to him when he calls once and twice, ſuch a one ought wholly to be depoſed, and never after be admitted to any Miniſtration in his Office, or receive his former Honour: but if afterwards he does continue to trouble and divide the Church, he ought to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed by the Civil Power, as a mover of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> So that the Church Univerſal, I ſuppoſe, will undergo the like Cenſure with me from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as <hi>ſpeaking like</hi> Rehoboam<hi>'s Puny-Councellors</hi> But it is undoubted, that it has been the conſtant Doctrine of the <hi>Greek, Eastern, Northern,</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> Churches, as well as <hi>Roman</hi> in all Ages, that Chriſtians ought to be in Subjection to their reſpective Biſhops; and he was held cut off from the Catholick Church, that did ſeparate from his lawful Biſhop, or was juſtly excommunicated by him; and no other Church could receive him, till Repentance and Reconciliation to his own Biſhop, and 'tis the ſame at this very day. And that 'tis the Senſe of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Churches alſo, may be ſeen in their Confeſſion and Apology above quoted, where I ſhew likewiſe, it was the Opinion
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:152722:201"/>of <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> in the Circumſtances that I now ſpeak about, and that it is the conſtant Doctrine of the Reformed Church in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> that every private Perſon ought to be ſubject to his particular Paſtor; and no Paſtors ought to preach without publick Allowance, is alſo beyond all Diſpute, as is evident from their Confeſſions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. So that it being the Senſe of all Churches, that for a private Perſon to be in Communion with the Catholick Church, it was neceſſary he ſhould live in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that Paſtor and particular Church, under whoſe Government he did reſide, while he did keep to the Catholick Rule; Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and all others muſt yield Obedience to his Dioceſan Biſhop, and the Laws of that Provincial Church where he fixes his Habitation here in <hi>England,</hi> if he will approve himſelf a Member of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; and this I did over and over inſiſt upon, though I did not make a formal Definition of the Church. And this was abundantly ſufficient for our Peace, ſeeing our preſent Differences are not ſo much about Doctrine, as Government, and Circumſtances of Worſhip. And that our Doctrine and Liturgy give no juſt Grounds of Separation, no man has more fully ſatisfied the World than Mr. <hi>B. Is
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:152722:202"/>not the Non-conformiſts Doctrine the ſame with that of the Church of</hi> England,<note place="margin">Defence of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Love, p. 64.</note> 
                        <hi>when they ſubſcribe to it, or offer ſo to do?</hi> Ibid. p. 59. <hi>Moſt of the Liturgy is the reading of the Scripture it ſelf, and the rest is ſound Matter.</hi> And then to ſatisfie the World how univerſally our Church and Liturgy are approved of amongſt the Reformed Churches, he ſayes, <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 88. <hi>All the Reformed Churches in Chriſtendom, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly profeſs to hold Communion with the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Churches in the Liturgy, if they come among us where it is uſed. Therefore it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me to be Perjury and Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either to preſer no publick Worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Liturgy, or to refuſe occaſional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Churches that uſe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, as a thing meerly on that account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> So that when I had ſhewed that all Chriſtian Churches were agreed in the Matter of our Doctrine and Liturgy, and that for the Government, it was that which was ever obſerved in the Church for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years, and that thoſe Churches who had not ſuch an orderly Succeſſion as we have, yet did approve of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; without any farther Definition, I ſaid abundantly enough to ſatisfie Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and all others, that in order to their avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Schiſm, and being ſound Members of the Catholick Church, they ought to live
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:152722:202"/>in all peaceable Subjection and Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and refrain all preaching and joyning in any Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; and this is the ſenſe of the Catholick Church, ſo long as our Doctrine and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy are ſound, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelf does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they are, and the Reformed Churches likewiſe, do acknowledge by their joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Communion. Nay, what I ſaid, was more full and ſatisfactory in our preſent Circumſtances, than any Definition could be; for it is more to bring down Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Circumſtances of every man's particular Duty, as I did, than it is to make a general Definition, and leave People to make their Inferences, which few have learning and underſtanding enough to do for themſelves, in Matters of Controverſie.</p>
                     <p>All that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> generally has to ſay to this, is, that we differ about the kind of Epiſcopacy, and ſo all theſe things do not concern him; to which I anſwer two things; that we may altogether wave the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the diſtinction between Biſhops and Preſbyters in this Matter; for the Law of the Church does require even Biſhops themſelves, to ſubmit to the common Rules of Order and Unity, which are appointed in each City and Province; and therefore all theſe Teſtimonies do however concern Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who does act againſt the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:152722:203"/>Conſtitutions, duely and lawfully eſtabliſhed in this Nation, by the ſeveral Governours in their reſpective Capacities; ſo that though his raiſing Diſputes about the diſtinction of Orders amongſt Biſhops and Preſbyters might ſerve his purpoſe amongſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> where he was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and found a Church, yet they can do him no Service here, nor warrant him to exerciſe his Office in a ſetled Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the allowance of the Governours.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, His diſtinguiſhing Epiſcopacy into ſeveral Species, is but a meer Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own, for the Order of Biſhops is one and the ſame all over the World, and ever was in all Ages and Times; 'tis not Riches, or the largeneſs of his Charge does make Biſhops of another kind from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; This St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayes many times, and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and the whole Church. And then as to Dioceſan Biſhops, I have ſpoken already, Ch. 5. beſides ſo much has been ſaid in their Defence by the Reverend Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> and the Author of the Vindication of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church againſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that nothing need be added about them. And in truth Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own Conceſſions ſeem Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to any Rational man; for he cannot deny that St. <hi>James</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> long
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:152722:203"/>within the Apoſtles times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So other ſingle Perſons in other great Cities, and that muſt be a more tremendous Charge, than a Dioceſs of a hundred or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pariſhes in a Country. And a Biſhop of ſuch great Cities, with their adjacent Villages and Suburbs, muſt have ſeveral Prieſts under him, and they muſt hold ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Congregations, and have ſeveral Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, to be able to adminiſter all Offices duely to each particular Perſon, which is plainly a Dioceſan Church, and ſo all Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s pretences come to nothing. And 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in all the Hiſtories and Canons of the Church, that never any more than one Biſhop at a time was allowed in any of theſe great Cities, (neither will Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s notion alter the caſe, if it be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed true, for that was but a temporary Permiſſion, as the Obſervation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites was, and no conſtant Rule.) And if a Schiſmatick did ſometimes creep in, as the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Times, they were alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church, which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintain there ought to be but one Biſhop in a City or Dioceſs, and all Prieſts and Lay-perſons ought to be governed by him.</p>

                        <hi>Indeed the Lord Chief Juſtice thought that the Power of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the Ministerial Office, was of God's Inſtitution; and that they were the proper Judges appointed by Christ, to whom
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:152722:204"/>they themſelves ſhould apply Sacraments, or to whom they ſhould deny them.</hi> So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Reverend Judge, the Power of determining all Matters of Religion, that concern the publick Communion of the Church, is by divine Right inveſted in the Governours of the Church; therefore any that by vexatious Prohibitions, Calumnies, and Moleſtations, do go about to weaken their Authority, or hinder them in the faithful diſcharge of their Office, do oppoſe the Inſtitution of God. And ſo do all thoſe that draw away People from the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their proper Governours, and take upon themſelves an Authority to hold Conventicles, and ſet up a Communion contrary to the command of the lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters inſtituted by God, as the proper Judges to inſtruct and govern the People in their ſeveral Charges.

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:152722:207"/>they may hear in moſt places throughout the Kingdom, and are not contented to ſlight and undervalue the ſound Preaching they may have, and leave empty Seats and naked Walls where they ſhould attend God's Service, but perſecute, revile and ſcorn that Miniſter whom they ſhould honour and obey as their lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, to follow an Interloper that thruſts in himſelf, not only without any miſſion to that place, but any pretended Orders at all, ſo much as Preſbyterian, as 'tis in my own Pariſh. And then Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to palliate all, tells the World, we hinder Preaching, we deny People Food for their Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Non-conformiſts are not ſuffered to preach in our Churches. Theſe things ſober men cannot reflect upon, but with grief and ſadneſs; and the bitter Complaints which God's faithful Servants have juſtly ſent up to their heavenly Father, for the Neglect and Contempt that has been ſhewn to their Perſons and Labours, by theſe Diſſenters which complain for want of Preaching, who are upheld in their Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and Diſobedience by Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Writings, will one day be repreſented little to their Comfort.</p>
                     <p>And in the mean time 'tis a hard Caſe, after they have robbed us of our Flocks that are committed to our Charge, and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:152722:207"/>bred them up in Ignorance, Pride, and Diſobedience; robbed us of the Love and Friendſhip of our Neighbours; robbed us of the great Comfort of our Lives, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing the Fruit of our Labours, but made our ſelves and Labours ſlighted and deſpiſed; yet if at any time we write to vindicate the Church and our ſelves, and to have theſe Evils redreſſed, then we have Cart-loads of Declamations thrown upon us, <hi>for stirring up Perſecution againſt the Godly, ſpeaking like Rehoboam's Puny-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, being Enemies to Preaching, ſilencing Godly Miniſters, hinderers of God's Word;</hi> when any indifferent man that looks into our Writings, will ſee our great Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, are to withdraw People from their Ignorance, Errour and Profaneneſs, and bring them to hear ſound and ſaving Preaching, and be guided by it.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks he has now ſufficiently prejudiced his Party againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> and her Miniſters; and therefore ſayes, p. 230. in the end of this Book, <hi>I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, —hereafter, to let the Matters of meer Conformity comparatively alone,</hi> and will write about <hi>the univerſal Church Supremacy.</hi> So that as far as I can ſee, he will go about to prejudice his Diſciples againſt hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Authority of the univerſal Church and General Councils alſo, and ſo
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:152722:208"/>make himſelf the univerſal Dictator and Controuler to the Church. But I deſire this Juſtice from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that if he thinks fit to meddle any farther with me in this Controverſie, that he would firſt throughly conſider how I have ſtated the Matter, and then give his Reader my words impartially, or at leaſt their Senſe fully repreſented, with my Conceſſions and Limitations; and then if God give me Opportunity, I will return him a fair and candid Reply. But before he publiſhes his Thoughts, I would wiſh him and all ſober men ſeriouſly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; whether to ſet aſide the Authority and Cuſtom of the univerſal Church, and free general Councils; and inſtead of them, to ſet up a man of four and twenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> choſen by the ignorant Rabble, and make him an independent Arbitrary Biſhop, be a way to bring the unlearned and unſtable to ſound Knowledge, and to ſettle Peace and Holineſs in the Church. For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and me, is not whether the Scriptures contain all things neceſſary to Salvation,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Orig.</hi> of Plots, p. 99. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> or whether the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof ought not to be preferred before all humane Writings, for I defend this as well as he; but when there ariſe Controverſies about the true Senſe of theſe ſacred Writings, in things that concern the Eſſence of Chriſtianity, and the Peace of
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:152722:208"/>the Church, whether I may not more ſafely rely upon the Wiſdom and Honeſty of the Church of God in all Ages, and the deliberate Expoſitions of free General Councils, than the private Interpretation of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and ſome few of his Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conforming Brethren? For God has told me the Church is Holy, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not and will not deceive me in things that ſhe will propound as neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but I have no ſuch aſſurance of the Holineſs and Wiſdom of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, or every private man. Therefore when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has wearied himſelf with needleſs Diſputes, and done what he can to defame the ancient Biſhops, (for which he has much to anſwer) and diſparage the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of General Councils; yet ſtill as often as we can ſay, (as we can in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Differences) <hi>If any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtom,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.16.</note> 
                        <hi>neither the Churches of God,</hi> ſober and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding men will be moved by it.</p>
